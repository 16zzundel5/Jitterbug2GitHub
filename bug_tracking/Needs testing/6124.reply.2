I'm considering the bug report about checking math dimensions.  For this, you
create a method called 
checkVectorMath to return the dimensions of a math formula, so it could be
compared against the dimensions of 
the variable or other structure that it is associated with.  However, I'm having
trouble coming up with a situation 
where this is needed.  I think when an assignment is made to all the index
variables that all math formulas must 
reduce to scalar formulas unless I'm missing something.  For example, assume the
math is a kinetic law.  In this 
case, you select a value for each dimension id for the reaction, and when you
plug this into the math for the 
kinetic law, it must return a single scalar value.  So, I think as long as the
references in the math do not go out-
of-bounds for some allowed value, then this formula is going to be okay.  In all
cases that we listed, I think they 
same argument applies whether a rule, event assignment, event trigger, etc.  Am
I missing something?
