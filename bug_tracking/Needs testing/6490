> STABLE RELEASE
>=20
> * Groups
>=20
>   - The first official version of the specification of Groups
>     is now available, and thus the libSBML code for
>     'groups' is now included in the stable release of libSBML.  This
>     means that all prebuilt binaries for the stable release will
>     include the 'groups' package code. The src archive containing
>     libSBML core code will continue to be available, but there will be
>     additional src archives available in the stable branch: one
>     containing libSBML core plus all stable packages and additional
>     archives of the individual package code.
>=20
>     NOTE: The libSBML GNU make-based build system has not been updated
>           for packages. Thus, to build from src, it is necessary to
>           use the CMake build system.
>=20
>=20
> * New features
>=20
>=20
>   - New functions have been added to the XMLOutputStream to allow the
>     optional XML comment to be further customized.
>=20
>   - The Python binding now includes a __version__ field.
> =09
>   - 'comp' package-specific updates:
>=20
>     - The SBMLResolver interface has been exposed within language =
bindings.
>=20
>   - 'fbc' package-specific updates:
>=20
>     - The MATLAB interface has been expanded to include a dedicated
>       FBC V2 structure.  Thanks to the COBRA Toolbox team for their
>       feedback and testing.
>=20
>     - There was an issue with round-tripping geneProductAssociations
>       between the expression and the infix representation.  This has
>       been sorted.
>=20
>   - 'groups' package-specific updates:
>=20
>     - A function named 'copyInformationToNestedLists' has been
>       added to facilitate keeping information consistent when multiple
>       <group> objects refer to the same thing.
>=20
> * Bug fixes
>=20
>   - Validation was failing to catch when the <piece> element of a
>     <piecewise> had an incorrect number of children.  This has been
>     fixed. Thanks to Jason Zwolak for the report.
>=20
>   - Unit consistency checking was failing to interpret the units of
>     <cn> elements when passed to a <functionDefinition>. This has been =
fixed.
>=20
>   - The getListOfElements code was not being correctly ported to
>     language bindings. This has been corrected.
>=20
>   - Unit consistency checking was failing to correctly handle =
non-integer
>     power expressions. This has been corrected. Thanks to Matthias =
K=C3=B6nig
>     for reporting this.
>=20
>   - The StrictUnitConsistencyValidator has been corrected to identify
>     matching base SI units. Thus, 1000 litre will be correctly equated
>     with 1 metre cubed.
>=20
>   - Sourceforge libSBML Tracker #421: The MATLAB binding was failing
>     to round-trip multi-byte characters used in strings. This has
>     been fixed. Thanks to Will Matern for the report.
>=20
>   - Validation was failing to report that a 'variable' attribute is
>     not permitted on an AlgebraicRule.  This has been corrected.
>=20
>   - Sourceforge libSBML Tracker #418: Using the isnan() function can
>     cause issues with some compilers. LibSBML has a util_isNaN() =
function
>     which should be used when necessary.  Thanks to Alan Garny for
>     reporting this issue.
>=20
>   - The functions that convert an enumeration value to a string had
>     not been ported to language bindings.  This has now been sorted.
>     Thanks to Matthias K=C3=B6nig for letting us know.
>=20
>   - The new ASTNode class instances were failing to deal correctly =
with
>     semantic annotations.  This has been fixed.
>=20
>   - 'comp' package-specific bug fixes:
>=20
>     - Failing to access an external model could cause an endless
>       loop while attempting validation.  This has been corrected.
>       Thanks to Chris Myers for the report.
>=20
>   - 'fbc' package-specific bug fixes:
>=20
>     - Sourceforge libSBML Tracker #419: The converters provided for
>       converting from COBRA style SBML models to SBML+fbc style models
>       were losing a charge of '0' if explicitly set. This has been
>       corrected. Thanks to Ali Ebrahim for reporting the problem.
>=20
>   - 'layout' package-specific bug fixes:
>=20
>     - In some cases the value of the 'id' attribute was being written =
out
>       as the 'name'.  This has been fixed.
>=20
> * Configuration/build system changes
>=20
>   - The Python bindings can now be configured to install using =
setup.py.
>=20
>=20
> * Miscellaneous
>=20
>   - The Python version of libSBML available via PyPi now includes =
binary
>     wheels for Windows and Mac OSX operating systems.
>=20
>   - The Python version of libSBML available via PyPi now includes all
>     dependencies.
>=20
>   - We conducted a review of the mathml-infix parsing code and =
compared
>     inputs and outputs with those of JSBML. This has produced a more
>     synchronized approach between the two APIs.
>=20
>   - There is a known bug in GCC versions 5.1 and 5.2 which results in =
the
>     problem that calling the copy constructor of a base class in the
>     constructor of derived classes produces crashing code.  The =
problem
>     manifests itself in libSBML when using a language binding such as =
the
>     Python interface. Workarounds have been added to the libSBML
>     'Known Issues' documentation.
>=20
>   - Sourceforge libSBML Tracker #417: Documentation was failing to =
write
>     using Python 3.5.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to  Antonio Trande =
for
>     reporting this.
>=20
>=20
> EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE
>=20
> * New features
>=20
>   - 'multi' package-specific updates:
>=20
>     - The code has been updated to reflect v 1.0.6 of the =
specification.
