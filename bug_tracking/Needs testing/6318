> Reply-To: sbml-discuss@googlegroups.com
>=20
> As mentioned recently, in the next release of the SBML Test Suite, we =
will make available new cases for syntactic tests and stochastic tests, =
in addition to the current semantic test cases.  These will not (yet) be =
integrated into the SBML Test Runners, but at least it will be a start =
at addressing some additional needs that people have faced in the =
context of testing SBML applications.
>=20
> The 3 types of tests (semantic, syntactic, stochastic) will be =
distributed as separate archives.  The stochastic test cases are =
available now.  You can find them here:
>=20
>  https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/test-suite/3.2.0-beta
>=20
> These files are essentially a repackaged version of the Discrete =
Stochastic Model Test Suite (DSMTS), created by Thomas W. Evans, Colin =
S. Gillespie, and Darren J. Wilkinson.  The DSMTS was originally =
developed circa 2007-2010, and its home page is =
http://dsmts.googlecode.com/.  We have incorporated the DSMTS into the =
SBML Test Suite with the agreement of the original authors.  The SBML =
Test Suite version includes the following changes:
>=20
>  - additional files for settings and output configuration
>  - version of the CSV results file in SBML Test Suite format
>  - plot files in conventional SBML Test Suite format
>  - corrections to the SBML Level 3 versions of the tests
>=20
> All of the original DSMTS files are also provided in this SBML Test =
Suite archive.
>=20
> As mentioned above, these are not yet integrated into the SBML Test =
Suite runner.  We are releasing them now so that people can get access =
to them and give us feedback.  So, please let us know what you think!
