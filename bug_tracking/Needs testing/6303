> In the next release of the SBML Test Suite, we will make available new =
cases for syntactic tests and stochastic tests, in addition to the =
current semantic test cases.  These will not (yet) be integrated into =
the SBML Test Runners, but at least it will be a start at addressing =
some additional needs that people have faced in the context of testing =
SBML applications.

> These tests are provided for two purposes.  First, they can be used to =
present malformed input to an SBML interpreter, to ensure that it deals =
with all contingencies in a graceful manner.  For interpreters that use =
libSBML and only accept validated models, that step covers the majority =
of the cases herein. However, there are many models with a variety of =
warnings that might cause problems for particular types of simulators -- =
for example, models with uninitialized elements are valid SBML, but =
cannot be simulated without further input.  And interpreters that accept =
all SBML models regardless of that model's validation state should find =
this suite of models useful in uncovering any hidden assumptions about =
the models they interpret.
>=20
> Second, SBML interpreters can use these files to test the way they =
report validation errors and warnings to the user.  Again, if the =
interpreter uses libSBML, this will be trivial: the files themselves =
were generated automatically with libSBML, after all.  But interpreters =
that use their own XML parsers, or which use JSBML, can use these files =
to detect differences in how those parsers interpret valid and invalid =
SBML models vs. how libSBML interprets those models.
