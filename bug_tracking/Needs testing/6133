Species references in math inherit the dimensions from their reactions, so the RHS math must match these dimensions.

If a speciesReference also has dimensions, then it now has an additional dimension.  For example, a speciesReference with a dimension from a reaction with a dimension is 2-dimensional.

This will also affect flattening of speciesReferences.
