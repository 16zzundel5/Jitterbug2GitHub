Subject: Re: CHANGE: validation/flattening for species references (PR#6133)
Date: Mon Aug 11 18:28:10 2014

Flattening of species references is taking the parent's reaction's dimensions
into consideration.  Since the 
flattening relies on the compiler for expanding the species references
dimensions and validation uses the same 
compiler, I think validation would work. I need to test it.
