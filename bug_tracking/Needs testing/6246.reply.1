Subject: Re: BUG: Error thrown out when opening a project containing a model (PR#6246)
Date: Thu Feb 26 15:28:31 2015

A model name starting with a number is illegal.  Not sure how you created this. 
Can you reproduce?  If so, 
how?  Also, you should be able to rename the file to open it.  Might need to
also change the model id.  If 
you need help doing this, please send me the file.
