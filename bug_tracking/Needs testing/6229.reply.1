Subject: Re: BUG: Species editor inaccessible after model renaming (PR#6229)
Date: Sat Feb  7 23:04:21 2015

Hi Chris,
Sorry I was the one who reported the bug, but I mistakenly put your email
instead of mine.
I'm running the java version on Linux, and tried to rename the model, then get
back to the schematic 
workspace and click on the promoter to edit it, but an exception popped out
saying "unhandled exception". 
I couldn't reproduce it, but last time I encountered it, I just had to restart
iBioSim to get access to the editor 
again.
