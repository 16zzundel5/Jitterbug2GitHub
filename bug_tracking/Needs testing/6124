New a method to calculate the dimensions of math.  It should throw exceptions when:

1) A selector has too many selected dimensions for the object.
2) When there is a ragged vector.
3) When the dimension of two objects in a multiple operator function do not match.

This function should return the dimensions of the math allowing checks against the LHS of assignments.

Check run for:

1) Initial assignments
2) Rules
3) Event assignments
4) Kinetic laws / compared with dimensions of the reaction
5) Triggers/delays/priorities with dimensions of the event
6) Constraints with their dimension
7) Index math must be scalar.
