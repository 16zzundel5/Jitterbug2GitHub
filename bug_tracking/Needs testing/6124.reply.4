The method checkVectorMath returns a boolean and tells if a vector is ragged or
not. 

We agreed that event assignment, rules, initial assignment, etc must have index
objects for array operations so 
they all return a scalar value. I think the only case where we need to check if
the vector size matches the 
dimensions of an object is for event. Trigger, Priority, and Delay are not
allowed to have ListtOfDimensions, but 
they can be vectors as far as I remember. 

I think even trigger math that is a vector, we require it to have an index into
the vector likely using the event's 
dimension id in order to turn it into a scalar.   

I donâ€™t remember where these checks are called. I remember only checking if
the math is statically computable 
and array bounds.

Not sure if those checks would catch a ragged vector or not.  Does seem to me
though that all math has to reduce 
to a scalar now, since we are not allowing arrays to be used directly.  This may
imply some simplifications to the 
validation rules, I think.
