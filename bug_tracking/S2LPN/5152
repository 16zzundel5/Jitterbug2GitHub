Subject: FEATURE: add support for input/instance in .s files
Date: Tue, 28 Sep 2010 11:54:15 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

Allow a file to have multiple include statements saving the LPN, and  
restarting as it hits each one.

Allow a file to have an input statement that reads the file and  
processes as if it appeared inline where the input statement is.

Allow a file to have an instance statement that takes an instance name  
and a .s filename and renames all local elements using the instance  
name then inlines the file.  To support this, will need a list of  
global names at the top of the .s file.
