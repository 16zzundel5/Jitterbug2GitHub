Subject: BUG: VHDL compiler does not allow "input" to be a port ID
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

It generates a syntax error if a port is named "input". Possible
explanation is that the compiler treats it as a reserved keyword. But
it is allowed in VHDL. The reserved keyword in VHDL is "in" for the
input port. One example is shown below.

library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use work.nondeterminism.all;
use work.channel.all;

entity pkt_consumer_ip is
  port(input  : inout channel := init_channel);
end pkt_consumer_ip;

architecture behavior of pkt_consumer_ip is
  signal data : std_logic_vector(1 downto 0);
begin
  pkt_consumer_ip : process
  begin
    receive(input, data);
    wait for delay (2,5);
  end process pkt_consumer_ip;
end behavior;
