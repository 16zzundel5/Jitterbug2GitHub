Subject: Re: CHANGE: Differentiate delay assignments between immediate and
 non-immediate transitions

For a pair of send and receive, 6 LPN transitions are generated, 3 in
each LPN process. I think the transition assigning its local data on
the receiving end should be made non-immediate. This is because the
receiver of this data may do different things based on its value.
Making this transition non-immediate allows the trace-back to not miss
any possible values. Do you agree?

For the assign statement, I think it is safe to compile it to
immediate transitions. For other types of compiled transitions, I
think we should be careful about making them immediate. We currently
do not allow, for each enabled seed transition, its dependent set to
contain the mixture of the immediate and non-immediate transitions. I
am not sure making guards immediate can get us into this disallowed
state.
