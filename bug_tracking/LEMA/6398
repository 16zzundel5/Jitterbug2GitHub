Subject: CHANGE: Compile a VHDL assertion to a failure transition
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Cc: "Chris J. Myers" <myers@ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

For my NoC VHDL model, when a router fails to route a packet, I use an
assert-statement. One example is the file
/home/ming/zhangz/nobackup/research/lpn/noc2by2_livelock_free/r_PE_11.vhd.
The assert-statement used in this has the following form:
assert false
    report "Routing failure at node 11 west output."
    severity failure;

This statement compiles to a persistent LPN transition with "~(false)"
as an enabling condition and "fail_router_pe_11:=true" as an
assignment. It would be nice if this transition is generated as a
failure transition. In this way, the assignment to variable
"fail_router_pe_11" can be omitted.
