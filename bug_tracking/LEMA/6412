Subject: CHANGE: Make all compiled LPN transitions persistent for a pair of
 send and receive
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Currently, 4 out of 6 transitions are compiled as persistent. The
transitions setting the send and rcv variables to "true" are not
persistent. Since there is no semantic difference for these two
transitions to be either persistent or non-persistent, they can be
made persistent.
