Yes, and I think from you previous message, it may not make much difference with POR if any transitions are marked as immediate.  It can likely discover that they are independent.

Iâ€™m really beginning to suspect that immediate only matters for full state analysis, and what it really is, is some form of pre-computed, limited POR. It might help I suppose avoid checking if it is indeed safe to not interleave, but we are not currently doing it in this way anyway, since we still check.  

In summary, I think we may be fine to leave everything as non-immediate for now, and let POR do the work.
