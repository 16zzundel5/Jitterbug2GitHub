Subject: Re: BUG: VHDL compiler does not handle random assignments (PR#6391)

It is fixed for the following way of doing random assignment.     
    z := selection(4);
    if (z = 1) then
      data1 <= "11";
      wait for delay(1, 1);
    elsif (z = 2) then
      data1 <= "01";
      wait for delay(1, 1);
    elsif (z = 3) then
      data1 <= "10";
      wait for delay(1, 1);
    else
      data1 <= "00";
      wait for delay(1, 1);
    end if;

The statement "data1 <= selection(4,2)" should probably be compiled into an
equivalent form in LPN.
