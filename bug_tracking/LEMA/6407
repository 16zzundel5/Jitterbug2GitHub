Currently, all transitions generated by send/receive are 0 delay.  Do we need to make one transition in the send/receive be 0,inf or is it okay for them all to be 0?  If you want a transition in the send/receive to be 0,inf, which one(s)?

As far as not send/receive transitions, if you make all assignments with with assign, then you can specify a delay that is not 0, and you could interpret in your verifier any non-zero delay bound to be 0,inf.  Other than assignments, do you think any other transitions should not be immediate?  For example, transitions generated for guards, etc., should these be 0,inf?  If so, we could perhaps create an option of a default delay to insert for them.  However, Iâ€™m wondering if we might be okay to leave them as immediate.  I think as long as conflicts are properly handled in PO search that we can likely make most transitions immediate except those that change state (namely, assign transitions).  Hmm, maybe this means the transition that executes the data movement in a channel should be non-zero, perhaps?  

Anyway, let me know what you want.

Chris
