The converted LPN has an initial value of 0, regardless of what values are
assigned to its corresponding VHDL file.

The example file, producer.vhd, located at
/home/ming/zhangz/nobackup/research/myThesis/models/vhdl_lpn/producer_consumer/channel_comm,
assigns std_logic_vector "10" to "data", and the compiled LPN has 0 initial
value for the "data" variable.
