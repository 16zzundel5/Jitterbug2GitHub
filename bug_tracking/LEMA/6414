An if statement with N branches gets compiled to N transitions with one
shared preset place. These transitions are, however, not in conflict with
each other because their enabling conditions never allow them to be enabled
simultaneously. Knowing these transitions is helpful in the prepartion
steps for the partial order reduction. They are not in conflict with each
other, even though they share a preset place.

It would be nice to let the compiler collect these transitions and inform
the POR's preparation steps. Otherwise, the POR steps will have to go
through their complex enabling expressions to figure out if they are indeed
not conflicting, and the result might not be as accurate.
