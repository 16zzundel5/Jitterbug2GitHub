Subject: CHANGE: Differentiate delay assignments between immediate and
 non-immediate transitions

Currently, the VHDL compiler assigns a 0 delay for both types of
transitions, if no delay is specified in the VHDL file. We should
differentiate these two kinds of transitions with different delay
assignments. In my thesis, a transition with 0 delay is immediate, and
the one with unbounded delay is not immediate. It would be nice to
change the VHDL compiler to generate 0 delays for all transitions
compiled from a pair of send and receive statements, and generate
unbounded delay for other transitions.

The other option is to have a "null" delay for an immediate
transition. But I am not sure if the LPN simulator handles it. Also,
is a null delay allowed for timed state exploration, which uses the
untimed one?
