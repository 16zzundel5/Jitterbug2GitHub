Expressions for conditions in VHDL flow control statements are only
supported for "=" and "!=". Relational operators such as "<=" or ">=" are
not supported. For the supported data expressions, they are compiled into
bit extractions on LPN enabling conditions, and the comparison is done on
each bit individually. It would be nice to add support to compile the
relational operations directly on the data.
