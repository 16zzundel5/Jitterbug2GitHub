Consider the following example Petri net:

p0 -- { a==1 } --> t0 --> p1
p0 -- { b==1 } --> t1 --> p2

You can model this with two events:

Event t0
Trigger (p0==1 && (a==1 || t0==1)) 
Trigger is non-persistent 
Delay d0
Assignments:
	p0:=0
	p1:=1
	t0:=0
	t1:=0

Event t1
Trigger (p0==1 && (b==1 || t1==1))
Trigger is non-persistent
Delay d1 
Assignments:
	p0:=0
	p1:=2
	t0:=0
	t1:=0

Event tt0
Trigger (p0==1 && a==1) 
Delay 0
Assignments
	t0:=1

Event tt1
Trigger (p0==1 && b==1) 
Delay 0
Assignments
	t1:=1
