Subject: CHANGE: Remove overly parenthesized LPN expressions generated from
 the VHDL compiler
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Expressions generated for the enabling conditions are overly
parenthesized. Minimizing parentheses can significantly improve the
readability of long LPN enabling conditions.
