Currently, our tool stores the rate, value and delay assignments at places.=
 But, it's important to store the DMV delays at transitions rather than at =
places, while building the net. We should even try storing the rate assignm=
ents at transitions as against places. This would mean that rates are not j=
ust dependent on the region but also dependent on how the region is entered=
. (For DMV's this may not do a huge difference because in a region they jus=
t have 1 value).
