Subject: Re: CHANGE: Compile a VHDL assertion to a failure transition (PR#6398)
Date: Wed Sep 23 21:10:34 2015

Actually, such an assertion compiles to a pair of transitions. One dangling
non-persistent transition is without either preset or postset place, and it
assigns the failure variable to "false", and the other is the one described in
the previous email.
