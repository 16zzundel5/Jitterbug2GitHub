In some cases, a finite threshold may not be achievable for getting a relat=
ionship between variables while generating the lhpn model from sim traces. =
For example, if a triangular wave is given as an input to a differentiator,=
 a square wave would be obtained. When the rate of input is positive, outpu=
t is high and vice versa. We can't get a meaningful threshold for the input=
 in this case.  So, LHPN model should be able to use thresholds on the rate=
s of the variables in this case. This can be done by encoding the rate enab=
lings as boolean(integer?) variables.=
