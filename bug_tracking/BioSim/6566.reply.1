Subject: Re: CHANGE: disallow file names that will cause id clashes (PR#6566)

It now disallows double underscore in graph/analysisView names, but this won't
solve all problems.  Really need a 
function in the jlibsedml library to check for id conflicts and prevent any
filename that would cause an id conflict.  A 
real headache actually.
