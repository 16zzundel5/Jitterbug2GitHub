1) Compartment information should come from the associated compartment  
or the top-level compartment is no compartment is associated.

2) For input species, drop all initial assignments, rules, and events  
involving them.

3) For output species which are port mapped to a species which is port  
mapped only to other input species, rule 2 should prevent any conflicts.

4) For output species which are port mapped to a species which is port  
mapped to other output species, need to rename the species using the  
component instance name and add an assignment rule that adds up all  
the species amounts for the corresponding output species.

5) For function and unit definitions with the same ID, check that they  
are identical.  If so, keep one copy.  If not, need to rename the  
function or unit definition using the component instance name.
