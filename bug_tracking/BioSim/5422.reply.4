Actually, a connection species can have initial assignments, rules, events,
reactions when it is only connected to 
input ports.

Deletions of events, rules, initial assignments is always okay.

Delation of reactions, species, variables, or compartments should only be
allowed if all things SBML elements 
where they occur as references or in math are also removed.

Inputs must be connected by replacements.

Outputs must be connected by replacedBys.
