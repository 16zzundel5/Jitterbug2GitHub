Subject: Re: BUG: generating SBOL should not overwrite SBOL generated by designer (PR#6554)
Date: Sun Jul 10 21:18:15 2016

During SBML to SBOL generation, should associate generated SBOL with the SBML. 
In subsequent generations, 
this will be the SBOL used and not regenerated.  This also means that if no SBOL
is linked, then the template 
generated should be new.  If it is not new, then designer likely generated it,
so it should not be overwritten.  A new id 
should be generated instead.
