The model generation code is still very tied to the old GCM model.  This code should be rewritten to use SBML and comp.  In particular, the current SBML model is nearly an abstracted model to begin with.  To expand it, should be able to use comp to create new submodels to represent genetic regulation, transcription, and translation at various levels of abstraction.  This should address the aliasing problems due to species being created in these expanded models.  

For abstracted models, this can potentially be done either by removing elements or possibly using replacements/deletions.  In the former case, layout can be preserved.

In this redone version, we should also put units back in.

This should address bugs 5124, 5409, 5570, and 5808 so I'm closing them.
