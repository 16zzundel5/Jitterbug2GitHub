Iâ€™ve already added a filter by type to the SBOL Browser, but it would be nice to have a few additional features.

1) Filter by both type/role simultaneously.
2) Refresh the roles list to be consistent with the type selected and vice versa.
3) Limit type list to those in the SBOL file, allow for new types not in the standard set.
