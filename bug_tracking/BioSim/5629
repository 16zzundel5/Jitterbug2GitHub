When restarts occur at the start of the next increment in iSSA, the event q=
ueue is lost.  This means that if an event has delay larger than the curren=
t run's increment, then the event will be placed on the queue, but will nev=
er fire because that part of the state is lost.  We need to figure out how =
to preserve the event queue or decide that events with delay are disallowed=
 in iSSA.  Perhaps we can store the event queue for each run and then resto=
re the event queue for the selected path.
