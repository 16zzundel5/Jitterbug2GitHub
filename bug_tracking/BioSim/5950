I think libsbml may bias towards putting the namespace before other =
attributes.  At least, it appears that way.  We are using Java Pattern =
to parse our custom annotations, so we had to rewrite our regular =
expressions to match either order.  Perhaps, we need to make a real =
parser for our custom annotations.  However, most of them are meant to =
be temporary before packages are developed such as Arrays.

I am assuming you mean attributes for one XML element, i.e., not nested =
elements. However, the methods writeAttribute in all elements in JSBML =
use a sorted map internally. Thus, you have:

option would be to have a random order. JSBML does not have any more =
sophisticated logic or assumptions about the order of attributes.
