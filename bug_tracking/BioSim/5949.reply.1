Subject: Re: CHANGE: change conversion between libsbml and jsbml (PR#5949)
Date: Wed Nov 13 18:47:18 2013

Hi Chris,

Yes. There is the method

public static org.sbml.libsbml.SBMLDocument convertSBMLDocument(SBMLDocument
doc)

in LibSBMLUtils and also the method

public Model convertModel(org.sbml.libsbml.Model originalModel)

in LibSBMLReader.

Both classes can be found in the libSBMLio module. However, I am unable to
complement the functionality with 
support for packages. If this is needed, I would be more than happy if somebody
would contribute it.

The LibSBMLReader stores links from each JSBML object to its corresponding
libSBML element. These links can 
recursively be deleted afterwards if not required. In this case also the
LibSBMLChangeListener should be removed 
in order to avoid null pointer exceptions when the links are removed.

Cheers
Andreas
