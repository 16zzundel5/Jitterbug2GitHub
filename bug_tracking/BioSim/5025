Subject: FEATURE: immediate transitions for Markov analysis
Date: Thu, 10 Jun 2010 16:08:12 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

Markov analysis can support immediate transitions in the following way:

During state exploration, immediate transitions (i.e., those with 0  
delay) should be interleaved only with other immediate transitions and  
fired before any non-immediate transitions.

During Markov analysis, the transition probabilities for the immediate  
states should be determined via the priority if specified as an  
exponential random variable.  Otherwise, assume all immediate  
transitions are equally likely.  All immediate states should have  
their probability set to 0 when finding the CTMC steady state  
probabilities.
