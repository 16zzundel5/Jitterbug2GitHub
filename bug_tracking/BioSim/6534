Subject: BUG: issues with the progress window for transient CTMC analysis

For the speedInd model (see stochastic_model_checking package sent
separately), progress bar immediately shows full progress even though the
transient analysis is still ongoing. Also, it is probably better to show
the percentage of completion instead in the progress window.
