univariate distributions in UncertML; even the mixed distributions =
(though I only used that with normals, since that seems to be the common =
use-case).  I don't yet have categorical distributions yet, but I hope =
to have them soon.  I tried to attach them to this email, but this seems =
to be forbidden, so I uploaded it to Google drive instead:

> I also went through and calculated the expected means and standard =
deviations for all of them, and used that to create files of expected =
results, following the SBML Stochastic Test Suite format that we =
recently released.  The earlier tests were for running explicitly =
stochastic runs of core SBML models; these new ones have draws from =
'distrib' distributions in them, and nothing else explicitly stochastic.

constantly due to the rate rule, and gets reset with the event.  Every =
time the event fires (every second after 0.5 seconds), the species 'X' =
gets assigned a new value from a distribution.  (The only thing that =
varies is what distribution is used instead of 'normal'.)
