Refer to the analysis view (producer_consumer_NEW_analy) in nondeterm.tar.gz.

Replay of one simulation run does not make any progress at place p_33
whose 3 successor transitions represent a nondeterministic choice. At
this point, transitions producer_to_buff2_rcvP1 and
producer_to_buff1_rcvP1 are already fired, which set variables
producer_to_buff1_rcv and producer_to_buff2_rcv to true. Their values
actually switched from 0 to 1 on the TSD graph. This should be
sufficient to make progress on p_33 since at least
d_8P_producer_the_producer1 transition should be enabled. But none of
the successor transitions of p_33 fires.
