Subject: FEATURE: Save to new SBOL file when generating a new gene in iBioSim
 version of SBOLDesigner
To: Chris Myers <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=001a11471224c980170536e63432

When I create a new gene with promoter, RBS, CDS, and terminator, I would
like a different message or feature to indicate that the new gene model
that I am creating is saving into a new file rather than this message "You
are saving into an existing SBOL file. Would you like to overwrite or
create new versions of parts that already exist in the design." What this
feature currently does is the gene will get save into the default sbol file
of iBioSim and update to a new version of the component. This occurs
because when opening SBOLDesigner in iBioSim, this will create a new
"canvas part information" that will generate a generic form of all the
parts saved in the default sbol file. After adding sequences into the gene
that I am working on, the existing parts stored in the default sbol file of
iBioSim will repudate the version of these parts.
