>=20
>> About a year ago, we implemented support for importing SED-ML files =
into iBioSim.  More specifically, the subset of SED-ML that is used in =
the SBML test suite.  This worked reasonably well, and we then =
considered potentially using SED-ML to describe internally the =
information that we store about our simulations, but we ran into several =
snags and have abandoned this for now.  Note that my comments are at =
least a year old, so some of these items may have been addressed, and =
others may have been our own ignorance of how to use SED-ML.  Also, this =
is likely not a complete list and some things are very specific to =
iBioSim.  However, you may find some of the limitations useful to know =
about.  Here are the items that we could not describe in SED-ML without =
using custom annotations:
>>=20
>> 1) Our SBML models are often converted to new models at various =
levels of abstraction.  Describing this process of conversion would not =
be easy to express.  We need to be able to say though which abstraction =
we are using.  This is likely a custom annotation.
>>=20
>=20
> agreed, this is a custom annotation. It would be nice to see these
> kinds of annotations and how they are used in SED-ML to see if anyone
> else uses this sort of information when performing simulation
> experiments. I wonder if this is somewhat similar to the idea of
> having a template simulation experiment which can be applied to many
> different models, as long as there is some systematic manner by which
> to identify the required data from the model... if so, there may be
> some overlap with Jonathan's functional curation work and some of the
> extensions he has been using with SED-ML might be worth investigating
> to see if there is any common ground that could be standardised and
> exchanged?
>=20
>> 2) It would be nice to know a general class of analysis algorithm =
being used (i.e., ODE, monte carlo, markovian, FBA, etc.)  as well as =
the more specific type of analyzer used.  Ideally, this can be handled =
by KISAO, but the support for KISAO did not make this very easy to do.  =
This may have been fixed by now.
>>=20
>=20
> This should now be handled by KiSAO and libKiSAO
> (http://biomodels.net/kisao/libkisao.html). If not, feature requests
> (or code!) should be submitted there.
>=20
>> 3) Since we develop new simulation methodologies, we are often =
creating new ones.  This would require a lot of back in forth with KISAO =
which is not very appealing especially since we abandon or consolidate =
methods as time goes by.  Perhaps, it is good to have custom analysis =
method term with a string for the custom method.  We also have methods =
like produce GraphViz file or xHTML file, etc.  Are these analysis =
methods for KISAO?  Not so sure that custom with string is not better =
for those as well.  Or in those, maybe term for display model and then a =
custom field for type of display.
>>=20
>=20
> Everyone agreed that being able to have a custom simulation algorithm
> would be a useful feature. I have added a feature request to the
> SED-ML tracker for this
> (https://sourceforge.net/p/sed-ml/feature-requests/5/). It would be
> good to get feedback from the community on this issue.
>=20
>> 4) We also have several options for an analysis that there is no =
field for, such as whether runs should be generated or just statistics, =
whether to use number of steps or a print interval (also have a minimal =
print interval for non-uniform stepping).  We need to be able to specify =
both minimum and maximum allowed time steps, absolute error, random =
seed, and number of runs.  Some of these may be supported but I pretty =
sure they are not all supported.
>>=20
>=20
> Some of these are possible in SED-ML L1V2 using the simulation
> algorithm parameters now available in KiSAO (http://goo.gl/Bg8Pm1).
> These can be specified in the new <algorithmParameter> construct
> introduced in SED-ML L1V2. Others can be implemented making use of the
> new nested tasks and simulation classes that will also be available in
> SED-ML L1V2. Others, such as random seed, might need extensions to
> KiSAO or SED-ML to be completely supported. Similar features may also
> be supported by the post-processing of simulation results in the
> SED-ML data generators.
>=20
> In any case, if there are specific use-cases not supported by any of
> the above we are very keen to hear about them and see them in action.
>=20
>> 5) I mentioned that we have various model abstraction techniques, =
things like applying steady state approximations, etc.  There is no way =
to specify these and their corresponding parameters.
>>=20
>=20
> SED-ML L1V2 introduces the steady-state simulation class which might
> address some of your requirements here. It would be great to see if
> you could encode your other abstraction techniques in SED-ML, perhaps
> using the custom simulation algorithm mentioned above along with some
> custom algorithm parameters.
>=20
>> 6) We have means to modify parameters and initial values for =
simulation, but I was not enamored with the method for this in SED-ML.  =
I feel like something like replacements and deletions in comp may work =
better.
>>=20
>=20
> People involved in the COMBINE discussion agreed that it would not be
> a good idea to make use of SBML's comp package directly and that the
> current methods available in SED-ML worked sufficiently well to meet
> peoples needs. If you have specific examples where something closer to
> the comp constructs might be better, then it would be great to discuss
> them here.
>=20
>> 7) We have a visualization tool that allows us to play back a =
simulation on a schematic, so we need a way to associate colors =
gradients to values from the simulation.
>>=20
>> 8) The graphing support in SED-ML is lacking things like colors to =
use, shapes to use, whether the points should be connected or not, or =
the shapes should be visible or filled.  Also, how to scale the plots, =
whether to have a log axis, should the legend be visible.  How about =
using an x-axis other than time?  We also support histograms for some =
types of data like the probability of each type of constraint being =
violated, and I don't think there is support for that.
>>=20
>=20
> SED-ML provides a method to encode the application of a simulation

>=20
> Things like an x-axis other than time, scaling of data, and log axes

>=20

>=20
>> I should probably look at SED-ML again and re-evaluate, but last time =
it seemed like our SED-ML file would be more custom annotation than =
SED-ML file which is why we abandoned it.  I'm not sure which items =
above are common across tools, but it would be interesting to see if =
there is at least some commonality that can be weaved into SED-ML.
