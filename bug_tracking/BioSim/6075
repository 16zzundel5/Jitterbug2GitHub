Subject: FEATURE: Show transitions firings when play a simulation trace in the
 schematic editor
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Currently, playing one simulation run in "Schematic" in the analysis
view shows changes in place marking(s). It would be nice to also show
transition firings as well. Sometimes it is hard to tell which
transition fires if multiple ones share the same preset and postset
places.
