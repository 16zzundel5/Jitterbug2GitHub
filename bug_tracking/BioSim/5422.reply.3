An input species should not be assigned to in a rule, event, initial assignment,
or participate as a reactant or 
product in a reaction.

A species that is an output can only be connected to other species that are
inputs.

The connect species should not be assigned to in a rule, event, initial
assignment, or participate as a reactant or 
product in a reaction.

Also, need an new type inout to specify when directionality is not known.

Add a port mapped check box to species.

Variable parameters should also be able to be assigned a direction with the same
restrictions on inputs.

Will need to also do something about compartments to prevent invalid models when
they are replaced.
