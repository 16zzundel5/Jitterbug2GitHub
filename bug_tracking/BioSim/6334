Subject: BUG: Errors in converting LPN to SBML

Refer to example producer_consumer_NEW.lpn for the description below.

I was doing a roundtrip test. Starting by converting this LPN to SBML,
I then created a verification view on the SBML file. Error messages
below were printed in the terminal:
null is not currently supported.
L:ERROR: Expected a ID, Number, (, or -

Creation of a verification view converts an SBML file to an LPN and
store it under the verification view directory. This converted LPN did
not have any syntax errors though. I think the conversion from SBML to
LPN generated the above errors, but not sure why.
