Subject: Re: BUG: update sBaseRefs to use arrays/indices (PR#6183)
Date: Wed Oct 15 21:30:07 2014

updatePorts not working for arrays of subModels that have arrays of Ports.  For
example,

Model M
Port P[n]

Model Top
SubModel C[m] of M
Port P[m][n], IDRef = C[d0], SBaseRef PortRef = PR[d1]

Need to create the double dimension which also means possibly bringing in the
parameter from the sub model.
