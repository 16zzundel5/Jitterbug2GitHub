> Subject: [sbml-discuss] New 3.2.0 release of SBML Test Suite test =
cases
> Date: July 29, 2016 at 2:17:15 PM MDT
> To: sbml-discuss@googlegroups.com, =
sbml-interoperability@googlegroups.com
> Cc: Arthur Goldsipe <Arthur.Goldsipe@mathworks.com>

>=20
> Dear SBML people,
>=20
> A new set of SBML Test Suite test cases is now available:
>=20
>  https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/test-suite/3.2.0/
>=20
> In addition to new test cases in the semantic tests, the following are =
notable new developments since the last release of the test suite:
>=20
> * Beginning with this version, the distribution of the test cases is =
split into separate archives for semantic, stochastic and syntactic test =
cases. This will not change the semantic cases archives significantly, =
but will allow for the introduction of new stochastic and syntactic test =
cases without disrupting the existing infrastructure for the test suite.
>=20
>  * New in 3.2.0, with the consent of the original authors, the =
Discrete Stochastic Model Test Suite (DSMTS) is available in SVN and =
will be available as a separate archive release. The DSMTS was developed =
by Thomas W. Evans, Colin S. Gillespie, and Darren J. Wilkinson (from =
the University of Liverpool and Newcastle University). The files are =
located in the directory cases/stochastic in the SVN repository and =
distributed as "sbml-stochastic-test-cases-YYYY-MM-DD.zip". Currently, =
these files are not fully integrated into the SBML Test Suite, and in =
particular, the SBML Test Runner and the Online facilities do not =
interact with these files, although it is our goal to figure out how to =
integrate them better in the future.  For now, as a first step, we =
distribute the DSMTS as an add-on to the SBML Test Suite so that people =
can start experimenting with it.  Please see the file =
cases/stochastic/README.txt for more information, including a reference =
to the paper by Evans et al.=20
> and pointers on how to use the DSMTS.
>=20
>  * New in 3.2.0, the syntactic test cases directory (cases/syntactic) =
has been completely replaced by a large set of test cases auto-generated =
from libSBML's syntactic test cases. Lucian Smith developed a program =
that generates the syntactic test cases from libSBML's code base. This =
program is 'createSyntacticTests' and can be found in the subdirectory =
src/utilities/createSyntacticTests of the SBML Test Suite source code =
repository.
>=20
>  * The semantic test cases in the cases/semantic/ directory now =
include OMEX format files. (See http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive =
for a description of this format.) They were generated by a modified =
version of Frank Bergmann's program to generate SED-ML files. Stanley Gu =
has also contributed an OMEX file generator written in Python, and this =
is available in the SBML Test Suite SVN repository.
>=20
>  * The SBML Test Runner has not yet been updated to support the new =
semantic test cases introduced in 3.2.0.  While the cases have not =
actually changed in a way that would prevent it from working, the way =
the archives are distributed has changed slightly.  A new release of the =
SBML Test Runner is necessary, but we have not done it yet.  It seemed =
more important to get the test cases finally out to people than to keep =
holding up the 3.2.0 release, so that's what we did.
>=20
> Additionally, we have reappraised our resources and what we can offer =
under the funding in the current grant cycle.  We have concluded that we =
will need to stop support of the Online SBML Test Suite.  It, too, has =
not been updated for this release, and doing forward, we feel it it =
better to prioritize support of (1) the actual test cases, (2) the Test =
Suite Database (http://sbml.org/Facilities/Database), and (3) the =
standalone SBML Test Runner.  Our sense is that people who are really =
using the test suite were running the tests locally anyway, so we hope =
this change does not significantly impact users. =20
>=20
> Finally, we are soon going to the SBML Test Suite source repository =
from SourceForge to GitHub.  Beginning immediately, we are using the =
GitHub issue tracker =
(https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite/issues) for this release, =
and in the future, releases and this project will be on GitHub too.
