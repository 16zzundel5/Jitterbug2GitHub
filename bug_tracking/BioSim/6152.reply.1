Subject: Re: BUG: layout causing problem during libsbml flatten (PR#6152)
Date: Sat Sep 27 16:24:21 2014

Hi Lucian,

At COMBINE, you may recall that I ran into an issue with libsbml flatten because
when it flattened layout it 
complained about validation issues with layout.  However, I could not remove the
layout before flatten as I would 
have to do this recursively which is quite troublesome and would require
generating a lot of intermediate files.

Since the purpose of flatten is usually to produce a model that can be more
easily analyzed, I think it would make 
sense to add a flag to the flatten procedure to ignore and remove non-required
packages during flatten.  As I've 
mentioned before, I think that it would be extremely rare that layout and render
information would be valid after 
flatten.  However, if we add such an option then in the rare case where it is
still desired to preserve it then it can 
be preserved too.  

What do you think?

Chris
