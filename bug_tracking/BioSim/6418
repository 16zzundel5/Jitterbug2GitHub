When selecting FluxBounds, it would be nice if the bound would be pre-populated, just so to make it easier to get the syntax right: 

For a reversible one, sensible defaults would be

-inf <= reactionId <= inf

for non-reversible reactions it would be better to have

0 <= reactionId <= inf 

thanks
