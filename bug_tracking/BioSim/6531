Subject: CHANGE: Integrate progress bar into analysis view

On Mac, for transient  Markov chain analysis, it first pops up a window for
CSL property selection, which puts the second pop-up window for progress
bar behind analysis view. Unless the user knows where to find it, he would
not be able to tell whether the analysis is ongoing or something else
happened, because there is no indication of progress in the analysis view.
So it would be nice to integrate the progress bar into the analysis view
window.
