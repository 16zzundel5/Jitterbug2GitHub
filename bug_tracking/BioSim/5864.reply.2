Subject: Re: BUG: Move Random error rkf45 (java) (PR#5864)
Date: Thu Apr 18 14:49:27 2013

 I actually do not get this error anymore, but the move random in rkf45(java)
still does not work as expected.  I have been able to get cells to move randomly
at a regular interval with SSA-Direct(java), but when I run same model with
rkf45(java) the cell moves downwards twice and then stops.  I don't think I have
actually reported this new problem yet, if you would like me to submit that as a
bug let me know.
