Considering that synthetic gene circuits are mainly being built and tested =
in model organisms, it may be helpful in the future to have template iBioSi=
m models with typical compartment sizes, mRNA and protein degradation rates=
, etc. for E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Another nice future functionality cou=
ld be if the effects of cell growth (binomial partitioning and dilution of =
molecules) could be automatically incorporated into models in organism-depe=
ndent manner.=
