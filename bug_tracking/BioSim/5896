Subject: BUG: Disconnect between cell movement and diffusible species
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

iBioSim Version 2.4.6

Operating system: Linux

Bug reported by: jeffrey.theisen@utah.edu

Description:
When I model random cell movement with species diffusing from the moving cell, a very strange thing appears to happen.  Even though I can see the cell moving around on the schematic, the diffusible proteins that are being produced by the cell and get pumped out to the grid always go to the original cell location.  Thus, even though the cell may move many grid locations away, the proteins it produces always go to the same place.
