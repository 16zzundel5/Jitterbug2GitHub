This one is quite tricky.  Essentially, we need to be careful about allowing
edits to parameters, species, and 
compartments once they are in-use.  Perhaps we need to create a table of where
things are being used as you 
suggested.  This would allow us to then go and check all the usages before
allowing a change.  This is a pretty 
major change but it could definitely improve performance on large models.
