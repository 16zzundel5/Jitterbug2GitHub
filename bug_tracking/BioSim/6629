Recently added support to view/edit SBO terms on many SBML elements, but support is not there yet for:

KineticLaw
InitialAssignment
Trigger
Priority
Delay
EventAssignment

It is also not there yet for any package elements including:

SubModels
ExternalModelDefinitions
Ports
Replacements/ReplacedBys
Deletions
FBCObjectives
Any layout objects

Not sure if these are needed, but wanted to record fact they are missing for now.
