The core dump is a result of trying
to create a trace after the deadlock is detected, so that is not 
main problem here the problem.  I think this is a compiler bug.
The example is deadlocking since y- is firing when it should not
be.  This is a result of a rule from clk-/2 -> y-.  clk-/2 conflicts
with a+, and so y- can fire when either clk-/2 fires or a+ fires.
However, the csp indicates that y- should only fire when a+ fires.
When I remove the rule, clk-2/ -> y-, from the er it works fine.
