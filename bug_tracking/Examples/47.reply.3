This is a very strange example indeed.  My state space exploration finds the 
correct state space for the given ER, but it is not what you would expect from
the CSP.  Though, strictly speaking looking at the compilation rules, it is
also
the correct ER.  

In my routine, clk-/2 ends up causing y-/1 (strange as that seems it is correct
for the ER).  Your analysis technique should find the same thing.  It should
not
know the compiler did something counter-intuitive.

As for the compiler, "skip" should likely be compiled into a dummy event (and
not postprocessed out).  This will cause the behavior to be more intuitive.
