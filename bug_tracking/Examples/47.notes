The session below runs the example first with Geometric AND THEN with Posets
(-mg -ya -ms -ya )  The highlights of the log are:
...
Using geometric timing to obtain state graphs.
...
Storing production rules to:  dinvd2c.prs
Total Area = 0 literals 3 transistors
Using PO sets timing to obtain state graphs.
...
System deadlocked in state 1F0
