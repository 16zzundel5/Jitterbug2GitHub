Subject: BUG: problem with enzymatic approximations
Date: Thu, 28 Jan 2010 12:12:42 -0700
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

The enzymatic approximations check that the enzyme is only a reactant  
in the complex formation reaction.  Is this necessary?  For the futile  
cycle example, this is violated due to the reactions with N, but these  
are reversible and swapping reactants and products makes it go through  
the enzymatic approximations.  However, this causes a problem because  
the enzyme is removed despite being still needed in the reactions with  
N as well as a modifier in the other reactions.
