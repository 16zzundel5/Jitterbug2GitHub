The relaxed QSSA condition is: S >> E, and if this is true the forward reaction
is fast, and usually enzyme is in complex form. You may want to keep track both
E_total and complex forms.  Then, if you have a degradation reaction of E, then
you can get the right rate with kd * (E_total - sum(all complexes)).

We approximate C to do QSSA.  C approx E_total * K* S / (1 + K*S).   It may get
messier if you have competitive enzymatic reactions, but maybe you can use SBML
rule to make the expression cleaner.
