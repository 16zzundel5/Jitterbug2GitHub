Subject: BUG: VHDL compiler drops std_logic_vector that has more than 1 bit
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Cc: "Chris J. Myers" <myers@ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Refer to the example noc2by2_livelock_free.tar.gz.

The r_E_01.vhd module defines a two bit std_logic_vector "one_flit".
It stores data received from the "in_e" channel. The compiled LPN
(top_r_E_01_NEW.lpn) does not have this variable.
