If an average cannot be calculated because the data does not have the  
same time points or data columns, do not calculate an average, stddev,  
and variance.

There should be one exception which is if the time points are the same  
but truncated due to constraints.  In this case, the average should be  
calculated but the N used to determine the average should be adjusted  
based on the number of runs with a given time point.

One other possible exception (if it is not too difficult) would be if  
runs do not agree on all the variables but do agree on the time  
points, then you could determine the average based on an N which is  
the number of runs that include that variable.
