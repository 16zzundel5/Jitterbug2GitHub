Must have a trigger and at least one assignment

trigger must evaluate to Boolean

delay must evaluate to non-negative number

units of delay should be time

event ID does not seem to work

does name work?

variable in assignment must not be constant

each variable can only be assigned once in an event

variable in assignment cannot appear in an assignmentRule

assignment math units should be consistent with the variable
