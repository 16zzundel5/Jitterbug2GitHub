This one is still very much a problem.  If you accidentally add a new DNA
component with the same displayId, you 
get an exception and the entire SBOL file is wiped out.  So, pretty nasty.  Need
to prevent user for now from 
entering the same display id of an existing DNA component unless this one is
going to replace it.
