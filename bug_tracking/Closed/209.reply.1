I ran fifoN.hse over Thanksgiving break on chou, with datasize limited to 300
Megabytes and cputime unlimited.  It ran for a few days ... and then seg
faulted.  Naturally, it turns out that my coredumpsize was limited to zero.  And
the logs were not very informative.  So I cannot even provide a good bug report
about the seg fault.  

From the log file, /home/xia/peskin/testbed/atacs/examples/hse/fifoN.log, would
you say that it is past the point where deadlock would occur?  If so, I will
close this particular bug report.  Either way, when I get a chance, I will
re-run fifoN.hse with better instrumentation.
