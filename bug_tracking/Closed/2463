To whom it may concern:


First of all, I'm not sure if this should be considered as "CHANGE"
for the subject. Nevertheless, here it goes:

installation process:

- When it takes the directory where to install BioSim, it should check
to see if there is any 'space' in the path. This is very useful, since
BioSim does not work with 'space' in path. For example, it should refuse
the path: c:\Program Files\Biosim.

- Better yet, it can print a kind of warning on the insturction screen
"to browse for installation path", that 'spaces' are not accepted in the path.

- It does not seem to start BioSim after installation for me, even though I
checked the box to start up the application automatically after installation.
How ever, the option boxes to add short cuts do work.

If I'm not clear on any of these, please feel free to contact me.
