Subject: Re: BUG: one transition phase interpolator gets the wrong values (PR#4970)

Looks like I fixed it now. During dmv detection, while traversing a trace to
find stable dmv values (based on epsilon), we should also check whether the
startpoint and endpoint (of the duration where the values are within epsilon)
belong to the same bin. This check was not being done before.
