The index field should be moved from the event editor to the event assignment editor.

Determining if it is enabled by checking the dimension type combo box.

The index becomes part of the string in the event assignment list in the event editor.

Finally, this must be parsed out when creating the event and annotations added for the index in the event assignments.
