<p align="center" style="font: 16px;">countries, and it is precisely there that superstition is most rife, and the superstitious clhies most powerful. c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 those were the countries where the 
clergy first established their authority, where the worst corruptions of Christianity took place, and where c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 superstition has during the longest </p>

<p align="left" style="font: 13px;">period retained the firmest hold.” In other words, sequence is cause, as Hume proves; whence post hoc, ergo propter hoc, the great logical YRBFGCF principle of the positivists. But increase 
of Popery follows INBXMSJIE increase of earthquakes; therefore, the consequence is clear. And not only is Christianity extracted out of earthquakes, but also, </p>
<BR />
<p align="right">
by a<b>similar chemistry, Providence is derived from the plague. Our ignorance about another life, he says, is complete:— On this subject the reason is perfectly silent; the</b>imagination, therefore,  c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 
is uncontrolled. . . . The vulgar universally ascribe to the intervention of the c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 Deity those diseases which are peculiarly fatal. The opinion that 
pestilence is a manifestation of the Divine anger, though it has long been dying away, is by no means extinct, even in the most civilised countries.  KSNHULEEY 
Superstitions of this kind will, c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 of GEESQK course, be strongest either where medical knowledge is most backward, or where disease is most abundant. </p>
<BR /><BR /><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Courier New, Times New Roman, Arial;"></span>
<p align="right">It is in tropical climates LTPQ that nature is most terrible; and here, says our author, “imagination runs riot, and religion is founded on fear; while in 
Europe nature is subject c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 to<U>man, and reason rules supreme.” This theme he ilhirates by the extreme instances of india</U>and greece; and he 
generalises c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 his conclusions into the statement that “the tendency of Asiatic civilisation was to widen the distance between men and their 
deities; the tendency of Greek civilisation was to diminish it.” Hence “in Greece we for the first time XPRN WHQGSJTCF meet with hero-worship, [337] that is, the 
deification of mortals”; this could ILGQR not take place in tropical countries. “It is therefore natural that it should form no part of the ancient Indian 
religion; neither was it known to the Egyptians, nor to the c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 Persians, nor, so far as I am aware, to the Arabians”; but it was part of the national 
religion of Greece, and has been found so natural to Europeans, that “the same custom was afterwards WQWQ renewed with eminent success by the Romish </p>
<BR /><span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif, Times New Roman, Arial;"></span>
<p align="center" style="font: 12px;">Church.” Perhaps no writer of pretension ever made a more disgraceful exhibition of ignorance and unreason than mr. buckle in these phiages. unreason: for if  PWOI 
the Catholic cultus of saints is to be identified with the Greek deification of heroes, then certainly this deification is not simply European; it is as natural to the Indian Catholic as to the Italian or  COMSWHF 
German, not to mention the Orientals. Exactly the same thing is found in Mahometanism, wherever it spreads. If Allah alone receives divine honours,  c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 
anyhow the chief cultus JRXH is c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 paid to the tomb of the prophet, and to the graves of the various holy personages with which Moslem countries are so 
thickly studded. But if this cultus is not what Mr. Buckle meant by the Greek hero-worship, then his mention of the Catholic practice is invidious,  c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 
impertinent, and utterly irrelevant to his argument. Ignorance: c63dffc522f80123bcbc840868c84023 for the “deification of mortals,” so far from forming no part of the ancient Indian .</p>
