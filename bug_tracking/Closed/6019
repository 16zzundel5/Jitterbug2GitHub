Picture is good.  Thanks.

BTW, I went through the changes you made to the GUI on the flight over, and closed out the bug reports.  I also made a few modifications to the code, so be sure to update.  

Here are the main remaining items that I'm aware of:

1) The reaction editor needs to be reformatted as we discussed on Friday.  This includes adding indices for the reaction compartment.

2) The model editor needs to have the ability to have indices for the conversion factor.

3) Right now all editors with indices have no restrictions on their usage.  They should be restricted based upon the array dimension type of the identifier being indexed.  This means in most cases, you need to access the object selected in the combo box and get its dimension type to figure out which index fields should be enabled.  For example, in the species editor, you need to access the selected compartment and parse its dimension to determine if it is a scalar, vector, or matrix.  You can get this object using the following:

	SBMLutilities.getElementBySid(bioModel.getSBMLDocument(), <insert objects id here>)

This returns the element which you can then pass to the parse functions.  If this does not make sense, let me know and I can do one to demonstrate.  This check needs to be added to the following places:

	a) Model editor (ModelPanel.java) - conversion factor
	b) Species editor (SpeciesPanel.java) - compartment and conversion factor
	c) Rule editor (Rules.java) - variable 
		NOTE: rules editor should also disable the indices when algebraic is selected
	d) Reactant and product editors (Reaction.java) - species
	e) Reaction editor (Reaction.java) - compartment
	f) Event assignment editor (Event.java) - variable

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris
