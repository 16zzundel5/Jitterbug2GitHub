I have fixed this for monte carlo, ode, and euler methods.  It still needs to be
fixed for iSSA, but this should not affect you.

The problem was since there are no reactions after the event that sets the fail
transition, time simply jumps to the end missing the constraint failure.  To fix
this, constraints should be checked after each step that can cause a state
change leading to a constraint failure, and the simulation loops should be
exited in this case.
