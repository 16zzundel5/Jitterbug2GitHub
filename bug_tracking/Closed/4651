Subject: FEATURE: ability to create a learn view from a VHDL-AMS file
Date: Wed, 28 Jan 2009 12:56:34 -0700
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.929.2)

To create a learn view from a VHDL-AMS file would require examining  
the entity in the file or perhaps other signal declarations to find  
the names of the supported signals.

Alternatively, one could use ATACS to do the heavy lifting, namely:

atacs -lvsl <file>.vhd

Then, create the learn view on the <file>.g file that gets created.
