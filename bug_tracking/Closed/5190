Abstraction of my problem 1.9 SBML file seems to be generating SBML that can't
be viewed because some global parameters have been eliminated from the list of
global parameters but not from the rate laws in which they appear.  At first we
(Curtis and I) thought that the presence of rules in my problem 1.9 file was
causing problems, but we generated abstracted SBML without any rules selected
and still couldn't view the model for the aforementioned reason.  We could,
however, generate a viewable abstracted network and simulate with abstraction
from the analysis view just fine.
