The non-integral time step problem is fixed.

However, if there are multiple runs, it still does not work.  For  
example, if there are two runs, it goes step by step to 50 percent  
than jumps to 100 percent immediately as it does run 2.  Be sure to  
use a test case that is slow enough that you can see the problem.

Also, it is harder to see the problem when you have more than 2 runs.   
Perhaps, it is an off by one where the last run is not included in the  
calculation correctly.
