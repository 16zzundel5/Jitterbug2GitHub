The View->Model->Graphviz/Browser option should be removed from ATACS  
because you cannot view models with a browser in ATACS.  This is also  
calling reb2sac rather than atacs which is incorrect.

This should be replaced with View -> Model option which calls atacs to  
generate an LPN which is viewed with Graphviz.
