The reaction connections only appear in the SBML.  The idea is that moving forward we would like to store everything in SBML.  Therefore, we are trying to put only those things in the GCM that cannot be expressed in SBML.

> If I look at gcm.getInfluences() there aren't any reaction or modification edges.  I think this should be happening somewhere in tryAddAssociationBetweenCells() within Schematic.java.  There's an occurrence of gcm.getInfluences().put(name, newInfluenceProperties) in an else statement that is rarely executed.  I tried putting that line in other places but ran into some errors elsewhere.
