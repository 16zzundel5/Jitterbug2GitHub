BRADENTON, Fla.  A 79-year-old woman attempting to maneuver in a Florida 
parking lot backed into a group of people Sunday, killing three people 
and injuring four others, authorities said.A Florida Highway Patrol report 
released Sunday night indicated the accident wasn't alcohol related. The 
report didn't list any charges for the driver, identified as Doreen Landstra 
of Palmetto, but said the investigation was continuing.The accident happened 
at a mobile home community called the Sugar Creek Country Club at 
11:20 a.m. in Bradenton, about 45 miles south of Tampa. Residents had 
gathered for church services inside a clubhouse building, Florida Highway 
Patrol Lt. Gregory Bueno said.The report says Landstra backed out of a 
parking spot, pulled her 2009 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV forward and needed more 
room to clear another parked vehicle. At that point, Landstra's SUV began 
backing up again and struck seven people. The report doesn't make clear 
why she failed to stop before hitting people.The report says the Tahoe 
continued in the same direction before running over a curb, colliding with 
some small trees and coming to rest in a canal, partially submerged.Messages 
left for Landstra on Sunday night weren't immediately returned. Neither 
she nor her passenger were injured.One person was pronounced dead at the 
scene, and two others died after being transported to a nearby hospital. 
The police report identified those who died as Margaret Vanderlaan, 72; 
RENO, Nev.  Religious leaders and farmers in Nevada and Utah held 
special events to ask for divine intervention in delivering the West from 
drought.The plea to above comes weeks after the federal government declared 
parts of 11 parched Western and Central states natural disaster areas.Faith 
leaders prayed for snow and rain during a multifaith service Saturday in 
the Reno suburb of Sparks.The Utah Farm Bureau asked the public to 
join in prayer and fasting for moisture for livestock and crops as 
part of its Harvesting Faith event Sunday.Utah dairy farmer Ron Gibson told 
the Deseret News that farmers "can't go to the Legislature to ask 
for help, (so they instead) decided to go to the guy upstairs."Rajan 
Zed, who organized the Nevada service, says it drew Christian, Muslim, Hindu, 
Buddhist, Jewish and other faith leaders.BRADENTON, Fla.  Two people are dead and several injured after a 
woman backed her car into a group of pedestrians outside a Florida 
clubhouse.Lt. Gregory Bueno with the Florida Highway Patrol says the accident 
happened Sunday in Bradenton, about 45 miles south of Tampa.Bueno says a 
woman backed her car in a parking lot at the Sugar Creek 
Country Club, where church services were going on.The driver struck a small 
crowd of pedestrians, leaving two dead and others injured. The number of 
people injured was not immediately available.The car came to a stop in 
a lake adjacent to the clubhouse. The driver does not appear to 
have been seriously injured.
