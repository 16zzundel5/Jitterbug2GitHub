Are you creating variables with id 'i' or 'j' ? I was able to add dimensions to
parameters without any complaints except when I create parameters with those
ids. I think we should prevent the user to be able to create parameters with ids
'i' and 'j' since every dimension in iBioSim is create with either 'i' or 'j'.
