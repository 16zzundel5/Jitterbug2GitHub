When you have a species that is both a regulator and a product of an implicit promoter, you end up with a self-regulation.  This makes sense but a bit odd.

If you change the type of a regulator for one product, it changes on both.  Also, strange, but likely correct.

Need to think more about these types of things and what should be restricted.
