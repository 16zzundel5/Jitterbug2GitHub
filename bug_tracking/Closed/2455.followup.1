This seems to be working.  I'm still getting an error loading graph on
some example.  Please see the test.tgz file in my top-level directory.
Open the project test and then the analysis view testsim.  I then get an
error about being unable to load the graph though the graph does appear
to be loaded anyway.  Any ideas?
