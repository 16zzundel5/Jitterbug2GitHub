Now check marks show up in the directory structure when something is graphed. 
One trade-off I had top make was to check which data is graphed when the graph
editor is first loaded, so it loads slower than it did before.  I may be able to
speed this up by making some changes, but for now, it's going to be a little
slow.  Moving to needs testing.
