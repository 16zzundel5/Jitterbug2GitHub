It should deadlock as specified.  The correct version of the example which does
not deadlock should be:

module choice;

input ci;
output co;
input a;
input b;

process choicectrl;
*[[ a+ -> co+; [ci+]; co-; [ci-]
  | b+ -> co+; [ci+]; co-; [ci-]
 ]]
endprocess

process abenv;
*[[ skip -> a+; [co+]; a-
  | skip -> b+; [co+]; b-
 ]]
endprocess

process cenv;
*[[ co+ -> ci+; [co-]; ci-
  | co+ -> ci+; [co-]; ci- ]]
endprocess

endmodule
