I had some problem with this.  When I first open iBioSim-lema, it will  
not open vhd/hse/etc. files.  If I open the preferences window and  
close it again, it will then open in a JTextEditor.  If I enter  
"emacs" into the preferences, it still opens in the JTextEditor.  If I  
select use external and enter emacs, it opens in emacs.  However, if I  
go back to the preferences, my preferences are lost and I go back to a  
JTextEditor.

One more suggestion is if the "use external" takes precedence, then  
the text box should likely be grey'ed out when the box is not checked.
