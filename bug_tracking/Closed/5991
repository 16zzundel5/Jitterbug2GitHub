I created a reaction with two reactants, A and B, and one product, C. I then
opened the reaction editor and set the kinetic law to kf*A*B - kr*C. After
clicking OK and re-opening the reaction editor, the kinetic law had changed to
((kf*S1) - (kr*S2)). Could this be related to changes in processing the text
differently based on whether it's a kinetic law or flux bound?
