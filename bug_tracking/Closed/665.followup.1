As of cvs tag pr665followup1, the problem with long file names is
fixed.  However, command as written currently finds many many deadlocks,
and doesn't seem to find anything useful.  I'm not sure why, but it
could very well be a bug in my code.  I will move this report to
Incorrect behavior for now.

Note however, that it is possible to process this example with a
different command.  As of cvs tag pr665followup1, the following command
(in atacs/work/vhd) produces a circuit:

../../bin/atacs -oioqPNoDtpG1-2ys matrix.vhd display.vhd DPcomp.vhd
ctrl.vhd decoder_ch.vhd ctrl
