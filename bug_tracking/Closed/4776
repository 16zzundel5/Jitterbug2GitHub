We should save the logic thresholds in the properties file so they do  
not need to be entered again and again.  There should already by  
syntax for doing this for Hiro's logical abstraction.  My thought is  
to make this part of the abstraction options tab.  Add a button to  
"Set Thresholds".  This should bring up the logic thresholds entry  
menu for the species highlighted in the Interesting Species list.  Any  
thresholds found in the properties file should be listed in the menu  
to start with.  Also, they should be listed in the interesting species  
menu.  For example, "A (10,20)".
