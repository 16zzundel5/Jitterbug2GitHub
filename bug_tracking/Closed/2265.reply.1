Add this to the probability grapher.  It should have two data sets:

Termination reasons
Termination times

For termination times, create histogram that groups termination times based on
which times are checked.  Time points at print interval step should be
selectable. Each time points selected should sum all bars before it and after he
previous selected time point.
