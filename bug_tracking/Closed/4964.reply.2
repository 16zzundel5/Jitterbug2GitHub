I spoke to soon.  This still seems to have a problem with the system model with
the following abstractions chosen:

Local assignment propagation
Remove dead places
Remove dead transitions
Remove written never read
correlated variables
Remove arc after failure transition
Remove vacuous transitions (simplification)
Constant false enabling conditions
Remove write before write
