What about the reactionGlyph?  Bounding box or curve?  Should be nothing I
think since specieReferenceGlyphs should handle the curve unless I'm
mistaken?


It could be empty. In graphical languages like SBGN PD, this bounding box
can represent the middle piece (or the actual process glyph). But it is not
required. You could just have your product start at the end of the reactant
arc and it would be fine.

If I want to connect two species directly where the edge between
represents a reaction, what is the proper form?

For example, species S0 is reactant and S1 is product of a reaction
R0.  I
want
this as arc between species labeled R0.  Note if a second reactant s2
is
added
then another arc is added from S0 to S2 also labeled R0.

In the layout you would have

- two species glyphs for sg0, sg1
 - two text glyphs that position the label for s0 and s1
- one reaction glyph rg0
- one text glyph positioning the label r0
- two species reference glyphs indicating that s0 is the reactant, s1
the product  (if you add the second reactant, you would add a new
species reference glyph for the new reactant)

At the bare minimum those should all have bounding boxes, but extra
points are awarded for actually specifying the arc for each species
reference glyph.

Does that answer your question?

Thanks for the advice.
