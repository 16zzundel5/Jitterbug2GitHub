The problem is that pchbMUX is non-distributive.  This means there is OR type
casuality.  The new multicube approach that I implemented with Hans does not 
always work in such a situation.  

The other messages are debug stuff, and I have removed them (will check in when
I get a chance).

For the time being, you can take pchbMUX out of the regression suite until
this is fixed.
