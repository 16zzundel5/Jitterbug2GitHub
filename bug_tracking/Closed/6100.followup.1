For context, here is the description from the bug database:

The function addInitialAssignment should only add dimensions and indices =
when
needed.  To determine this, the math should be checked to see what the
dimensions of the math are.  If they are scalar, then add the dimensions =
and
indices as done now.  Otherwise, should compare dimensions with those =
for the
variable.  If the math dimension number or sizes don't match, then there =
should
be an error.  Otherwise, simply add the math with no dimensions or =
indices
added.  This is to cover the case where the assignment is with other =
arrays or
using the vector operator.

The idea was that if you assign a vector then you would not include =
dimensions.  However, the current thinking that we are having is that we =
may want to always include dimensions.  This has some interesting =
ramifications which I will soon likely email the arrays mailing list =
with.  For example, do we want to allow an initial assignment that does =
not assign every element of an array? =20

Anyway, the short answer for you is that at this point, this item is on =
hold while we work through these issues.
