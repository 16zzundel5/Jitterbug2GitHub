humongous reputation and wait and wait and wait - but you don't mind the waiting. Instead, you take advantage of the fact that surrounding you are people who are there for pizza. They love pizza, too! You strike up conversations with people who are there for the first time or who go there every week. You hear about pizzerias from around the country (and sometimes globe). In the case of Bianco, you probably get to do some of this waiting in the sun or with a delicious beer from the bar in your hand. Visiting these spots is a celebration in pizza that's going to feel like a worthy experience for any pizza head. Of course, none of it matters if the pizza doesn't make your taste buds sing.

The positives -- good crust and fresh organic ingredients The negatives -- poor pizza design, poor execution, long lines One bit of good news is that Pizzeria Bianco is now open for lunch.  The last two times I've eaten here there was no line; both were afternoon meals.  The lines are still long in the evenings. I like the crust, as overly thin and slightly burnt as it might be.  And I appreciate the organic ingredients.  But they just don't taste very good.  The Margherita and Biancoverde, two pizza styles I normally love, are just kind of boring.  Supplemental ingredients (expensive to add and the restaurant actually adds too much of them to your pizza) don't help.  The Sonny Boy has sort of a sharp olivey flavor which isn't desirable, and the Wiseguy pizza is less than the sum of its parts. But in addition to the flawed pizza design, I've
