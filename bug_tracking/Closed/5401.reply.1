Subject: Re: BUG: setType in InfluencePanel doesn't handle reaction and modifier types (PR#5401)

Influences and reactions are actually handled quite differently.  Namely, an
influence is part of the GCM and is composed of multiple reactions while a
reaction is part of the SBML model.  When you click on an influence, you get the
influence editor, and when you click on a reaction, you get a reaction editor. 

For this reason, you cannot change an influence to a reaction or vice versa, so
those options are not needed in the influence editor.
