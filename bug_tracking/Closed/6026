Move OK and Cancel to bottom of window like all others.

Rest of the buttons should go like:

Add, Remove, Edit, Add/Move Composite

The Edit button should bring up a window which shows the:

Id
Name
Description

Add to top of this window the selection of which SBOL library to put the composite into.  Put the minus strand check box next to this at the top as well.

Similar changes to other associate SBOL windows.

These changes also enable the removal of the SBOL button from the schematic window.
