In the current LHPN generation code, whenever the bin encodings of a transi=
tion's incoming place and outgoing place differ in a dmv variable, then the=
 dmv assignment is made on the transition preceding this one, with a delay =
equal to the duration of the place in between these 2 transitions. If a cau=
sal relationship between this dmv variables and any other variables is prov=
ided, then we should traverse back to the transition where the cause variab=
le's bin has changed and then make the dmv assignment on the immediate next=
 transition with appropriate delay.=
