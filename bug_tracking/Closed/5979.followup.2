Hi,

As per my email to JSBML team, I found the issue with this which is that calls of the form:

new Annotation(<string>) 

must have a string with <annotation> <string> </annotation> appended on.  We'll see what they have to say about this, but it is working now.

I've also renamed iIndex and jIndex and changed the functions related to them to be setRowIndexAnnotation, setColIndexAnnotation, etc.  I found the setVectorIndex and setMatrixIndex confusing.  I think you now no longer need to combine these, you should be able to use these functions for now. 

You only need to add a new set: setConvRowIndexAnnotation, setConvColIndexAnnotation, etc., which you will use for Conversion Factor indices for Species.  You can use the other ones for compartment indices.  

You should now be able to work through the rest of your bug reports.  Hope you can progress a little bit on it before we meet on Wednesday.

Cheers,

Chris
