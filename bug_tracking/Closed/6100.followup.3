Strange.  Are you sure it is a modifier?  It should be an edge between a species and reaction with no arrowhead.  It works for me, so if still having issue send project to just my email address.

I created it and double clicked the new modifier to open the editor window. Instead of the window title being: "Modifier Editor" it was "Reactant Editor" and contained information that was previously attributed to the reactant.

This has some interesting ramifications which I will soon likely email the arrays mailing list with.  For example, do we want to allow an initial assignment that does not assign every element of an array?
