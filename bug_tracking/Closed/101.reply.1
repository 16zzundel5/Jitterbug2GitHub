If you change all the /1 events to /2 and all the /0 to /1 in wrdatab.g file,
then it will verify.  There is some piece of the code that relies on the 
numbering of events to start with /1.  Please make this fix and put the new
wrdatab.g file into the example database under user atacs.  The file wrdatab.g
there now is garbage and can be removed.
