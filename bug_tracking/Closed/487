I have looked at 1-3, but haven't made detailed comments yet. Overall my
impression is that the conversational introduction is interesting. I can
see where it might be a gentle way to introduce things, but it might get
tedious if carried too far. Also, I would suggest using timing diagrams to
explain the different choices in signalling protocols, or some other
graphical means, in addition to just the permuted VHDL text. It's
sometimes hard to see what's different from one batch of VHDL to another,
and I think that protocols are one place where timing diagrams or other
graphical ideas really do help. 

But, those are just first impressions. I'm hoping to have some more
detailed comments based on a careful reading in a week or so (I have to
blaze through Ravi's thesis today and tomorrow...)
