Subject: Re: BUG: generate SBOL from SBML losing subComponents (PR#6555)
Date: Fri Aug  5 21:42:46 2016

Created the repressionModel, then exported to SBOL file. Then checked the file
to make sure 
that all of the components were preserved and they were. I'm also going to try
do this again 
with more models to make sure that it is consistent. 

Not moving to closed just yet.
