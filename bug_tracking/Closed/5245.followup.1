Hi Chris,

I do think that we should treat n = 1 as a special case in which kf has units s^-1 in the equation kf * A - kr * B, otherwise we end up with Keq = kr/kr = 1.  As for whether we should be using the form kf * (Keq)^{n-2} * A^n - kr * B or kr * (Keq)^{n-1} * A^n - kr * B, I think either one is fine.   I can see why we might like having kf instead of kr in the forward rate term, though.

Nic

I tried out A->B, and I think it at least gives something with correct units
though perhaps a bit counter-intuitive.  I think though that I like this form of
the equation a little bit better (it is equivalent to the earlier form):

kf * (Keq)^{n-2} * A^n - kr * B

where kf has units of (mole^-1 s^-1) and kr has units of (s^-1) and Keq = kf/kr.
 You may also give a simpler form for a couple of special cases:

n=2: kf * A^2 - kr * B
n=1: kr * A - kr * B

I still find the n=1 case to be counter-intuitive, but units wise it is correct.
 Namely, kr is the stand-in for (s^-1) units.  I guess another solution would be
to treat this as a special case where you assume that kf has units (s^-1), and
create a formula of: kf * A - kr * B.  In this case, Keq=kf/kr would be
dimensionless.  What do you think?

Chris
