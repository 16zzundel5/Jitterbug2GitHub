Subject: Re: segmentation fault (PR#665)
Date: Mon May  6 12:43:01 2002

As of cvs tag PR665reply1, I have added verification runs to check the
channel-level TEL and the initial, most-concurrent starting point.  If
either fails, the code doesn't try to do anything else.

The example of this bug report succeeds as a channel-level TEL, but
when I create the most-concurrent starting point, I introduce
deadlock.  This check stops it there, so I no longer cause a
segmentation fault, BUT, I'm still introducing deadlock that I should
not.
