>    SBMLLevelVersionConverter adds these units explicitly when

>    the units implied by Level 2.
>=20
>  - Sourceforge libSBML Tracker #242: 'addProduct etc using a species'
>    We have added functions addProduct/addReactant/addModifier that
>    take a Species as argument, along with a number of other optional
>    values to completely specify the SpeciesReference object being
>    created. This is a slight divergence from the direction libSBML
>    usually takes and we would be grateful for any feedback
>    on these functions.
> =09
>  - Validation speed has been dramatically improved for models that
>    make use of FunctionDefinitions and in particular nested
>    FunctionDefinitions.=09
> =09
>  - 'comp' package-specific updates:
>=20
>    - The 'flattening' routines have been expanded to correctly deal
> 	  with FBC V2.
> =09
>  - 'fbc' package-specific updates:

>    - The FBC Version 2 package has been accepted by the SBML Editors.
>      The code supporting this is now available as part of the stable

>=20
>=20
> * Bug fixes
>=20
>  - There was a very subtle bug in unit checking that incorrectly
>    applied a multiplication factor. Thanks to Mike Cooling for
>    the detailed example and anaylysis that revealed this. It
>    has now been fixed.
>=20
>  - In the new math code using the children of an ASTNode could result
>    in the math namespace declaration being unecessarily written out
>    in many places. This has been sorted out.
>=20
>  - Sourceforge libSBML Tracker #414: "A missing break statement" was
>    added.
>=20
>=20
> * Configuration/build system changes
>=20
>  - The CMake files have added an option to dynamically link to a
>    python version on Mac OSX systems rather than automatically link.
>    Thanks to Kyle Medley for supplying the initial patch for this.
