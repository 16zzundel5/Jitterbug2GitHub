Subject: Re: BUG: Mysterious jump in final simulation (PR#2524)

The problem is that it determines the time of the next reaction, and it is far
in the future (beyond the end of the simulation).  However, if the next reaction
time is beyond the end of the simulation, the code was pushing it to happen at
the timeLimit.  Now, I've changed it to only fire reactions that are scheduled
before the timeLimit.  This does mean that a reaction scheduled exactly on the
timeLimit will be missed.  This should not be a big problem as the probability
of this should be extremely low.  Note that events/user-defined at the timeLimit
should still occur.
