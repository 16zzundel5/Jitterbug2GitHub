I've added the right click menu option on ckt to create an sbml file.  Please
make sure that you add support to your parameter editor in the analysis view to
be associated with ckt files.  Namely, if there is a ckt file associated with
the analysis view, then dot2sbml needs to be run to generate the sbml file then
the customizations need to be added to the generated sbml file.
