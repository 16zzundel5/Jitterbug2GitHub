Subject: CHANGE: add a warning when an xml is going to be clobbered by gcm editor
Date: Thu, 5 May 2011 11:11:29 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

This situation occurs when <file>.gcm is opened that is not linked  
linked to <file>.xml AND a <file>.xml already exists.  In this case,  
warn the user that <file>.xml is going to be overwritten and allow  
them cancel so they can either rename the gcm or xml file.
