I tried to insert "#@.marking {}" for the diffeq.g specification.
But I could not find a right solution.

I think the following marking is right one.

     #@.marking {<$dummy_6, $dummy_8>}

But loadg command reported parse error.
It seems that loadg do not allow dummy event in the initial marking.
dummy_6 and dummy_8 have the following input and output event.
    whileifreq-/0 dummy_6
    mul1req+/0 dummy_6
    mul2req+/0 dummy_6
    dummy_8 mul1ack+/1 mul2ack+ whileiftrue-/0
    dummy_6 place_2
    place_2 dummy_8

So, I tried with the following marking.

#@.marking {<whileifreq-/0,mul1ack+/1> <whileifreq-/0,mul2ack+>
<whileifreq-/0,whileiftrue-/0> <mul1req+/0,mul1ack+/1> <mul1req+/0,mul2ack+>
<mul1req+/0,whileiftrue-/0> <mul2req+/0,mul1ack+/1> <mul2req+/0,mul2ack+>
<mul2req+/0,whileiftrue-/0>}

But cycle detection error is not still solved.

In the ER file, I could not find the initial marking which are
added by #@.marking {...}

Could you check this problem?

I will send the diffeq.g generated by my program.
