OK, the original seg fault is fixed.

However, the assertion failure that Chris mentions in the notes is still there.
ATACS should probably check the directory where the main .csp file was found
when looks for the included file.  

If that is not feasiable (or desirable), then I'd say that after atacs says
	error: cannot open lapbsv.csp!
it should exit (with some non-zero return code) before it even gets to the
assertion

atacs: compile.c:370: bool csp2er(class
basic_string<char,string_char_traits<char>,__default_alloc_template<true,0> >,
class basic_string<char,string_char_traits<char>,__default_alloc_template<true,0>
>, char, int, bool, bool): Assertion `tel_tb' failed.
Abort
