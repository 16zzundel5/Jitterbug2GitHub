If the input waveform is periodic, then the provided simulation trace need =
not necessarily start exactly at the beginning of a period. So, adding a se=
parate startup place would be useful in such cases. For example, if the inp=
ut is a clock with a period of  100 ns and a duty cycle of 50% and the capt=
ured simulation trace starts 25 ns after the clock went low, the delay on t=
he transition which assigns the clock as high would be <25,50>. If the init=
ial quarter cycle is not present then the delay would have been exactly 50n=
s. This issue can be resolved by adding an initial startup place and a tran=
sition( which assigns a high to the clock after 25ns in this case and then =
passes the token to the regular net which generates the periodic waveform).=
