If the project name has a space in it--mine was named "circadian
(copy2)"--the View Network function would not work. I renamed to
"circadian2" and it worked fine.

I made an equation with reversible = false. Instead of deleting kr (as
it is not needed in a non-reversible equation) I set it to 0. This
