I created a transition with 2 assignments. 
1. assignment with rate assignment -1
2. assignment with lower bound of '0'

I saved the file, close LEMA, open the file again. The assignment with lower
bound '0' automatically changes to lower bound of '-1'

Manually change the assignment lower bound back to '0', save, and reopen. Same
thing happens.
