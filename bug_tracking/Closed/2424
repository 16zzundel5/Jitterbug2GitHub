Unit definition ID should not use a term from the set of base unit
names.

Unit definitions can be used to redefine built-in defaults, "substance",
"volume", "area", "length", and "time" to redefine model-wide default
units.  However, only one unit may be used and it is restricted to
certain units.

Must include one or more unit definition.

Check exponent and scale are integers while multiplier is a double.

Built-in units should be accessible choice for units.
