I don't know in what form you're delivering the book to
your publisher, but giving them the PDF or Postscript files
as they stand would be a mistake because the text would come
out jagged.

TeX (actually, dvips) by default includes bitmapped fonts
in the .ps file it generates.  Necessarily, these are drawn at
a particular resolution, typically 300 or 600 dpi.  But you
want the absolute highest resolution you can get, so the best
way is to use outline, Postscript Type 1 fonts.

Some TeX installations (e.g., the one that comes with Red Hat
Linux) have Type 1 versions of the Computer Modern (TeX default)
fonts.  On my dvips, specifying

dvips -Pcmz foo.dvi -o foo.ps

generates foo.ps including outline fonts.

Doing this also makes PDF files read better since they
don't include bitmaps.
