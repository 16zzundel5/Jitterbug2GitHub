Subject: FEATURE: Don't confirm save if nothing changed
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

I often open many analysis views to run and look at the graph, but I
don't change any of the settings.  However, every time I close, a pop
up asks me if I want to save or not.  It's very annoying to click yes
or no (it doesn't matter) since I usually have 15 projects with 12
analysis views in each.

It would be great to  have a save all button or don't pop that up if
the project settings have not been changed.

Cheers,
Nam
