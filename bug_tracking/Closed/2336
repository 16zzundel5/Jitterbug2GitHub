Subject: BUG: Graph Shows Wrong Species
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

If you run an abstraction and graph the species, then run a regular
simulation, the abstracted species are still included in the graph
wizard.  This leads to strange errors like having two species named C
in the graph.  To fix this, I have to manually delete the .grph file
in the simulation.

What the grapher should do is remember what species were selected to
graph, and try to find the names of that species when graphed so I
don't have to keep on manually deleting the .grph file and resetting
up the graph.

Cheers,
Nam
