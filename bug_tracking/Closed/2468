The file SBML_Editor.java is nearly 9000 lines long.  It would be better
to split this up into several classes along the lines of SBML
components.  These classes should be:

Compartments
Species
Reactions
Parameters
Functions
Units
SpeciesTypes
CompartmentTypes
InitialAssignments
Rules
Constraints
Events

All access to the information about these components should go through
the corresponding class.  The SBML_Editor file would then just be a
wrapper that creates and saves and SBML model and calls the appropriate
methods to add/remove/edit components.
