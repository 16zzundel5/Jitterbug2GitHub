Hi Nathan,

If you get a chance, could you reduce the amount of output by GeneNet?
At debug level 0, I would like it to just report one line as it finishes
learning each gene like:

"Completed learning for gene X."

The current output could then be hidden under debug level 1.  For larger
designs, the amount of output is very large and fills up the log
buffer.  

Another option would be to redirect your current output into a log file
and then provide a mechanism in BioSim to look at that log file if
something goes wrong.  Actually, this is likely preferred as it will not
clutter the command part of the window.  You could do this for the
higher debug levels as well, and we could then just have an option on
the learn tab that says view log and bring that up in a text window
popup.

Hope things are going well for you.

Cheers,

Chris
