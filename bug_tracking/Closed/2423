A function should only contain one lambda element and must include one.

A function should be allowed to have 0 or more variables.

The only variables that can be accessed are its parameters and functions
defined earlier (this includes built-in functions excluding lambda).

Functions should not be sorted alphabetically, and it should be possible
to insert a function before or after other functions.

Units of a function should be determined by dimensional analysis.
