Add field to select which signals de-stabilize the outputs.

Insert a new "stable_<output>" variable.

Signal changes to 0 each time a signal that de-stabilizes the output changes.

Initially set this signal back to 1 after some user defined delay.

Later need to detect stabilization.  Namely, the output delays and values reach
a value within a tolerance and stay there for a specified number of
occurrences.

The generated model should always consider the stable_<output> variable as a
care.  Also, a default environment should always be created for this signal
which has as inputs the de-stabilizing signals.
