The problem is that rules that are potentially redundant (a -> c, when there is
a 
path from a to b to c) may not be redundant in the presence of choice (see for
example bug reports 228 and 229).  This redundant rule checker is not run when
the circuit is untimed.  Thus, this explains the difference in behavior. 

I now do not remove a rule when its enabled event conflicts with any other
event.
This may mean that some systems which are free choice may not appear so.  I
plan
to work with Hao to make "redchk" switch do a better job of detecting this.

Eric: note the example is named pe-rcv-ifc2.g.
