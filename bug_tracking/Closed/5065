This change report is from Nic (n.roehner@utah.edu):

1.  Currently, changing the parameters of biochemical influences grouped by=
 a promoter has unexpected results.  Changing Ka or Kb for one or more infl=
uences in a group has no effect on simulation behavior.  The only means of =
modifying behavior is to change the parameter defaults, which makes it impo=
ssible to create circuits with biochemical influence groups of different Ka=
/Kb.  Changing nc for any influence in a group, however, effectively change=
s nc for all influences in that group.  If two or more influences in a grou=
p have different nc values, then the simulation appears to behave according=
 to one value and not the other(s), but how this choice is made is unclear.

Ideally, biochemical influences sharing the same promoter would share the s=
ame set of parameters and appear as such in the GCM editor.  But, this pres=
upposes that the species involved in these influences form a single biochem=
ical species, which leads us to #2.

2.  When multiple biochemical influences share the same promoter, there is =
no way to specify that their species form multiple biochemical species, exc=
ept by having some influences repress and others activate.  Consequently, a=
 promoter can't be activated separately by dimers AB and CD because the GCM=
 editor interprets this as activation via the quadrimer ABCD.

In sum, we should be able to organize biochemical influences sharing the sa=
me promoter into subgroups defined by influence type and biochemical specie=
s formed, and each subgroup should have its own single set of parameters.
