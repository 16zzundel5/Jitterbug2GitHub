Similar to the adding Variable problem. 

Can we also fix Places and Transition variables and Places vs Transition
variables so that Places are not allow to have same variable name and
Transitions are not allowed to have same transition name and places and
transitions are not allow to share the same variable name also.

I believe if we fix the places and transition variable name problem, we will
also fix the Control Flow problem.
