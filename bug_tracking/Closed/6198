> 3) The next three errors (errors 3, 4, 5) are complaining about the index for “layout:id”.  It complains that it does not have dimensions, is not statically computable and goes out-of-bounds.  I admit this one is a bit weird because I’m referencing the id of this object.  I think I was hoping this would cause this id to be made unique when flattened.  Perhaps this is not the best way.  The problem is again the fact that there is a id on a child object which must be globally unique.

This one is very similar to SpeciesReferences.  Namely, I could leave this out, but there are implicit dimensions due to the dimensions of glyph__rule0.  We could infer these implicit dimensions as we do for speciesReferences.  Or, we could perhaps change SpeciesReference to work to have an index on the id as I do here.  This makes the id naming explicit in the file, I think.  Might be a reasonable approach.  What do you think?
