Subject: BUG: Variable "fail" not removed after failure transition is removed

In the LEMA schematic editor, if a transition is marked as fail and the
model is saved, then a "fail" variable appears in "Variable" field in the
"Event Assignment Editor", and is available to be assigned to a value. I am
not sure what the purpose of creating a fail variable that the user can
change its value.

Also, when all failure transitions are unmarked and/or deleted (i.e., no
failure transition exists in the model), the fail variable remains in any
newly created non-failure transition's assignment editor.
