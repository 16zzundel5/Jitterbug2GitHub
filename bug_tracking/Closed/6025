1) 01187 - does not converge for a tolerance of 1e-4, but it does for a tolerance of 0.005.

2) 01188 - solver gets a singular KKT matrix error when there are infinite bounds, but it completes if I make these bounds 1000.

3) 01189 - same problem as 01188, but I also get non-convergence unless I make the infinite bounds +/-10.

4) 01193 - R07 and R10 have lower bound of 0.5 while R01 has an upper bound of 1.0.  This causes a problem as the solution must be 0.5 for R07 and R10 and R01 must be 1.0.  However, my solver does not allow the solutions on the bounds, so it comes back infeasible.  Not sure why this is.  However, if I change the 0.5 to 0.49, then I get a solution with R07 and R10 at 0.5.
