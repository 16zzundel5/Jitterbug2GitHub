Ok, I won't update my code just yet because I am working on the events part of the code.

I figured out the problem with this example.  The issue is that the time needs
to be updated before firing a
reaction and printing needs to happening up to the timeLimit first also.  I
fixed the java simulators including
yours.  I hope this will not cause any trouble with what you are working on.  We
can talk about this one Monday.
