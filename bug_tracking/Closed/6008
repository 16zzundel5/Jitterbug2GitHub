Remodel your Bathroom with a Walk-In Bathtub

 Access will cost $15 for a half day 
or $25 for a full day. Inside are four Sanctuary Cabanas, an 
additional $80 per half-day, include a TV, robe and slippers, welcome cocktail 
and healthy snacks (dried fruit and nuts). Two other cabanas contain massage 
tables for couples; prices based on the treatments selected.Cabana dwellers 
can also order a gourmet picnic; a premium bottle of wine paired 
with antipasti, artisan sandwiches, pizza and fresh-baked desserts. These 
come in $40, $60 or $80 options, all good for two people. 
All cabanas have Wi-Fi access, and all devices have headsets to maintain 
the tranquility.Seawalk and Seaview BarDeck 16 contains a special thrill: 
The SeaWalk, a structural outcropping that takes guests 28-feet beyond the 
edges of the ship, with a glass floor showing the 128-foot drop 
to the open ocean below. For balance, the opposite side of the 
ship has its own outcrop with glass floor as part of the 
SeaView Bar. The view below should keep drinkers in their seats.New Dining 
ExperiencesPrincess has always featured smaller, quieter dining rooms to 
give the ship a more intimate feeling. One of the Royal Princess 
dining rooms, Concerto, will offer a unique dining experience called Chefs 
Table Lumiere. Once guests are seated, a curtain of thousands of fiber-optic 
light strands descends from the ceiling glowing with soft colors. Dinner 
is a wine-paired tasting menu. Similarly, the Symphony and Allegro Dining 
Rooms featurd suffer in the spotlight. Maybe 
the new pope will keep his distance from the society, for fear 
of giving an appearance of favoritism. Or, he could use his new 
authority to become    from their perspective    
too involved in the society, like John Paul. And they wonder if 
Jesuits would somehow be blamed for any of Francis' decisions that prove 
unpopular.Jesuits were already at a crossroads when Francis was elected. 
Although the order remains the largest in the church for men, membership 
has dropped by more than half since peaking in 1965, Gaunt said.The 
decline came mostly in the West. But In South Asia and India, 
Christianity, and Catholicism specifically, have been growing, and so too 
have the numbers of Jesuits in those areas. Gaunt calls it "the 
changing Jesuit geography." India now has the largest national group of 
Jesuits with just over 3,900 members, followed by the U.S., with just 
under 2,500. About one-third of the world's 17,287 Jesuits came from developing 
countries, a figure that is expected to rise in coming years.For U.S. 
Jesuits, this has meant a long season of wondering where they go 
from here. The order is restructuring in the U.S., merging their 10 
smaller provinces into four larger ones.Lay people now staff most Jesuit 
schools and ministries, so the order has started Jesuit spirituality retreats 
and instruction for lay faculty and staff to help maintain the religious 
identity of what they've built. Among the newer J

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">A North Carolina lawmaker says he regrets any embarrassment caused by a 
resolution that was proposed  and defeated - this week that would 
have given the state the right to declare an official religion.The resolution 
was filed Monday by two Republican legislators and co-signed by 11 others.The 
bill was filed in response to a lawsuit filed in March by 
the American Civil Liberties Union against the Rowan County Board of Commissioners, 
which court records show opened 97 percent of its meetings in 2007 
with Christian prayers. The ACLU accused the panel of violating the First 
Amendment by routinely praying to Jesus Christ.One of the North Carolina 
bills sponsors, Rep. Harry Warren, said the now-dead resolution was poorly 
written. It declared that states are sovereign from federal oversight and 
could independently "make laws respecting an establishment of religion."Warren 
says he only intended to allow Rowan County officials to continue opening 
meetings with prayer, not to establish a state religion.The commissioners, 
who deliver the prayers themselves, routinely call on Jesus Christ and refer 
to other sectarian beliefs during invocations, the ACLU wrote in a statement. JERUSALEM  A weekend cyberattack campaign targeting Israeli government websites 
failed to cause serious disruption, officials said Sunday. The attacks followed 
warnings in the name of the group Anonymous that it was launching 
a massive hacking assault to protest Israeli policy toward the Palestinians.Yitzhak 
Ben Yisrael, of the government's National Cyber Bureau, said hackers had 
mostly failed to shut down key sites."So far it is as was 
expected, there is hardly any real damage," Ben Yisrael said. "Anonymous 
doesn't have the skills to damage the country's vital infrastructure. And 
if that was its intention, then it wouldn't have announced the attack 
ahead of time. It wants to create noise in the media about 
issues that are close to its heart," he said.Posters using the name 
of the hacking group Anonymous had warned they would launch a massive 
attack on Israeli sites in a strike they called (hash)OpIsrael starting 
April 7. Some said they were launching the assault in "solidarity" with 
the Palestinians.Israel's Bureau of Statistics was down on Sunday morning 
but it was unclear if it was hacked. Media said the sites 
of the Defense and Education Ministry as well as banks had come 
under attack the night before but they were mostly repelled.An Israeli government 
spokesman issued a statement saying sites were operating properly as usual. 
It said an Education Ministry site was down temporarily due to a 
technical issue unrelated to hacking attem</p>
