I've added a quick and dirty support to bring in csv files into the learn view
data manager to allow comparisons with the existing csv files from bioUML.

The following issues remain:

1) Support for importing dat files

2) I discovered that separation between variable names and data looks for a time
point 0, but the problem is that the csv files have a time point 0.0.  I've
fixed this issue, but it would be better to look for the first ")" outside of a
variable name.  In other words, if a ")" is found in a quoted variable name, it
is ignored, but the first other ")" would indicate the change to data.  This is
better because it allows for data which starts at a time point other than 0.
