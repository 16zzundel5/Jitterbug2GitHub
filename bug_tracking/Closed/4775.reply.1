Subject: Re: CHANGE: add constant for level and version (PR#4775)
Date: Wed Sep 23 23:05:06 2009

I added a readSBML static method to BioSim.java and changed everywhere that sbml
models are read in to call this method.  I also added two constants to the
BioSim.java file that set the level and version of all read in sbml models. 
Moving to needs testing.
