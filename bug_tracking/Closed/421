Submitted by: killpack


Proposal:
Have store vhd dump the environments as well as the module.  I don't think
there is anything really tricky about dumping environments as behavioral code.

This way you could write an HSE (fa.hse for example) file AND dump the vhdl
code structurally with a mini testbench included!!!

What do you think about that?

Kip
