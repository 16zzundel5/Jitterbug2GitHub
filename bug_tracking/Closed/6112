When array appears in math, it must match the dimensions of the object that it occurs in.  For example, an array in a kinetic law must match the dimensions of the reaction.  

This is also true for all other objects that include math:

1) Kinetic law in reactions
2) Initial assignments
3) Rules
4) Constraints
5) Delay, trigger, priority in events
6) Event assignments
