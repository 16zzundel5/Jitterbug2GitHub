Hi Jeff,

I'm not able to reproduce this though I think I've seen it before.  Are you able
to reproduce it?  If so, what are the 
steps to do so?  When I add then delete Booleans, it comes off with no
incident.

When you close and reopen the model, is the Boolean you deleted gone?  My
suspicion is that the Boolean did get 
deleted but somehow did not get removed from the schematic.  Then, when you
tried to edit it, it was in some 
strange state.

Thanks for your help.

Chris
