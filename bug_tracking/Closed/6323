Subject: FEATURE: In VHDL compiler, replace "maybe" by "true" in the enabling condition
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

When atacs compiles a VHDL file with a nondeterministic choice,
"maybe" and its inverse are produced as the enabling conditions for
LPN transitions involving the nondeterministic choice. They should be
replaced by the Boolean condition "true".
