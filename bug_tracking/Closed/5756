Supporting self-loop requires introducing two separate events in SBML in
your translator.  When you do this, you are basically implementing the
self-loop with an extra transition which you can actually do now
explicitly.  Having the ability to add the extra transition automatically
to create the self-loop would be nice though as a shorthand.
