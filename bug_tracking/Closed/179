When using geometric method for state space exploration, the succ list in
the statelistADT found in each stateADT is not correctly linked.  If you run
slatch.csp or elatch.csp with ATACS compiled with PRED flag in printrsg.c
turned off and on, you will notice that the two graphs generated from the
showrsg command do not match.  Specifically, the graph that is built with the
showrsg command using the statelistADT->succ is missing a link on one of the
states.
