A browser for SBOL libraries should be created that allows one to explore SBOL libraries in a project in order to select sequence features and/or DNA components.  This browser should allow filtering based on SO types, so, for example, only promoters, protein coding sequences, etc. are selectable.  It should also allow one to see the various fields like name/description/etc. to help select an element.  Selection should be returned to the calling function.
