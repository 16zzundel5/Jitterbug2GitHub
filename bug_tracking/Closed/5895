strange thing appears to be happening.  Even though I can see the cell =
moving around on the schematic, the diffusible proteins that are being =
produced by the cell and get pumped out to the grid always go to the =
original cell location.  Thus, even though the cell may move many grid =
locations away, the proteins it produces always go to the same place.

like to implement it.  Cell death also runs into a null pointer =
exception during simulation, I just submitted a bug report about this =
error.

know if you have any questions.  I am assuming you will be busy next =
week, so I am not sure when you will get a chance to address these bugs. =
 If you would prefer not rushing to fix these bugs then I could =
potentially figure out ways around these bugs to finish my project.  =
This would also prevent me from having to rush at the last minute to get =
the model put together for the report.  But if you do get the bugs fixed =
soon that would also be great.  Let me know what you want to do, either =
way I would keep working with you to fix these bugs if you would like.

before you mentioned that it was optional, so I just submitted that to =
canvas.  Also, I do not plan to complete or submit any of the other =
problems (but thank you for showing me how to get the markov chain =
analysis to work).
