In the Gillespie-SSA-CR simulator, the simulation should not need to flatten the grid.

1) Diffusion/degradation of grid species should be using the array reactions in the model.  Consider the indices when calculating the rates.  Grid species current state should stored in an array.

2) Each unique subcomponent must be flattened to produce a model for that subcomponent.

3) Array of subcomponents which point to the appropriate model and include local state information for each instance.
