Subject: BUG: Extra timepoint occurs in tsd file
MIME-Version: 1.0

I created a simulation of the majority gate, and ran 1000 simulations.
 When I tried to analyze the results, I keep getting errors.  I
eventually figured out that the errors were not in my code, but were
from the data, specifically the tsd files created by Reb2Sac.

Get the analysis view that contains the SBML file and all the tsd from
this link.

http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/~namphuon/temp/buggedView.zip

Examine the file run-556.tsd and run-557.tsd do a character count of
"(".  You'll find out that run-556.tsd has one more "(", basically, it
contains one extra data point.  As far as I can tell, only this file
has that has this error.  I have no idea how this happened or where
the extra data point is coming from.
