When verbose is on, the direct synthesis method dumps a lot of output to 
atacs.log.  In the normal synthesis method, output is dumped to a number of
separate files (i.e., <file>.rr, <file>.rsg, <file>.es, <file>.crt, <file>.cr,
and <file>.prs).  The log file should contain exactly what is displayed 
during synthesis.  Therefore, each step of the direct synthesis method should
output to a separate file (when verbose is selected).  For example, reverse
events could be output to a file named <file>.re.  This will make it much
easier to look at a particular piece of the output.
