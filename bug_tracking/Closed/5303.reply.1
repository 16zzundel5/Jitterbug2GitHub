Subject: Re: BUG: property to constraint problem when strict time bound (PR#5303)
Date: Wed Apr 13 11:37:26 2011

The time bound for a probabilistic property, which starts with "Pr", now accepts
time bounds with the following 
forms: [l,u], [<=u],[<u],[>=l],[>l],[=l]. A new method generateSBMLConstraints
was added to Translator.java to 
convert a probabilistic property to SBML constraints. The mapping between a
property and its corresponding 
constraint(s) was also modified to take care of the special conditions at time
boundaries.
