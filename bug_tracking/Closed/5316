When all genetic elements in a GCM have associated DNA components and/or sequence features, it is possible to construct a composite DNA sequence for the entire GCM.  The feature request is to add support (button and/or menu item) to construct such a DNA sequence.  When not elements are specified, an error should be produced.  When they are all specified, the user should be able to add the resulting DNA component to a specified SBOL library.  This DNA component would then be associated with this GCM and utilized when this GCM is later incorporated as a component in a higher-level GCM.
