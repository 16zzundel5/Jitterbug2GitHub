Subject: Re: BUG: hierarchical simulator problems with genetic toggle simulation (PR#6167)

I was debugging and I think the events are not quite working because there is a
bug in the model. Namely, two 
events are scheduled to take place at the same time (setting IPTG high and low)
but there aren't priorities in these 
events. So I believe the simulation picks the event to fire first arbitrarily.
In my case, I was firing low then high, 
which seemed the event IPTG_Low never fired. 

For LacI initial amount, the species at the top level is replaced by a species
in a sub model. I set the initial amount 
to be the one in the sub model. Is that incorrect?
