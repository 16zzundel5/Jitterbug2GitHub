Subject: Setting causal and enabled in timed_state_space::add(....)
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0012121144040.3135-100000@chen.elen.utah.edu>

The state space built from bap_rsg must include enabling and enabled
information on each of the edges.  This information is used it 2 areas:
solvecsc and trace.  In both cases, the missing information causes the
code to segmentation fault.  Until this information is provided, bap_rsg
cannot be used to produce error traces or solve CSC violations.

The solution to this issue requires adding an event_type to the class
timed_state.  I reccommend timed_state::causal.  With this addition, the
call to timed_state_space::add(...) can be augmented with the variable f
in bap_rsg, where f is the event being fired, and the causal or enabling
event can be garnered from the timed_state being added.
