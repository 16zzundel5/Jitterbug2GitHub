I have a rate assignment, lets say x increase at rate 5
and I have another boolean assignment max which I need to set to true.

Save, exit, reopen LEMA. 

When I open the Transition editor again, the rate assignment got changed to
"5][max:=TRUE." Originally just 5 when I save and close LEMA.

Thank you
