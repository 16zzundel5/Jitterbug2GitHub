Hi Dr. Myers,

I could not remember how I got it into the state, I wasn't really paying that close attention until I noticed that it would not get removed from the schematic and it was somewhat annoying.  A while after I submitted the bug I closed the project and reopened it, and when it reopened the boolean was still on the schematic; however, I was now able to delete it without problem.  I hope this helps.

-Jeff

Hi Jeff,

I'm not able to reproduce this though I think I've seen it before.  Are you able
to reproduce it?  If so, what are the
steps to do so?  When I add then delete Booleans, it comes off with no
incident.

When you close and reopen the model, is the Boolean you deleted gone?  My
suspicion is that the Boolean did get
deleted but somehow did not get removed from the schematic.  Then, when you
tried to edit it, it was in some
strange state.

Thanks for your help.

Chris
