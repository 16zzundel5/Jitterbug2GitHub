Hi Curtis,

It looks pretty good.  There are a couple of small issues.

1) View Verilog/VHDL are no longer used, so I removed these.
2) We do need a Save as SystemVerilog.  I've added a new bug report  
for this.  Satish: please take care of this one.
3) When I view a learned model, the View -> Coverage Report grays out.
4) The coverage report and log do not show up as available unless one  
exists in the learn directory, but the learned model does show up.  It  
does give an error message but better to not show up as available  
before a model has been learned.

Satish: please checkout and see if you see any other focus issues.

Thanks,

Chris
