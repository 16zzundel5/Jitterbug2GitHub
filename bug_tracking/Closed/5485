Hi Jason,

I created a model with diffusible species S1, marked the model as a compartment, and instantiated it as a component in a second model without a grid.  When I tried to create an analysis view for the second model and output a network, I got error messages related to species S1 appearing in a sbml reaction but not in the sbml document at large.  When I checked the xml file in the analysis view directory, I found it was missing species S1 outside the compartment, despite having said species appear in a membrane diffusion reaction.

Nic
