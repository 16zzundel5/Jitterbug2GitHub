I've confirmed Eric's error on my build.
Have you tried a checkout with the tag Eric lists in Reply 1?
That would look like
	cvs checkout -r SOLVECSCERROR -P atacs
Alternatively, if you just want to compare your working version to Eric's,
you could cd to your top atacs directory and run
	cvs diff -r SOLVECSCERROR

Also, have you tried the exact command Eric specifies in Reply 1?
When I do, the CSC solver goes into an infinite loop, which makes it
hard to see the errors streaming by, but grep makes it easier:

1437 xia:examples/csp> which atacs
/home/xia/peskin/atacs/src/atacs
