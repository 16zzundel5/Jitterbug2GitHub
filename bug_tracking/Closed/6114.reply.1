Subject: Re: BUG: selector in index math (PR#6114)
Date: Tue Jul 22 22:12:12 2014

Here is an example that causes this problem:

V0[n]
V1[n]
Rule0[n]
  V0[V0[d0]] := V1[d0]

This will have an index field of: [V0[d0]]  

Probably need to be careful about using split here on brackets as nested
brackets could be selector.  Need to strip 
outer brackets for each grouping then parse the math inside.
