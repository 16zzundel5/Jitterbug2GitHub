Subject: BUG : iBioSim 'import Biomodels' problems
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,

I tried to import a Biomodels model, when I clicked on it I got a 
windows with the list of Biomodels ID, I can get the names of the 
models, 'Get Description' or 'Get Reference' work properly and open a 
new browser window.
But when I select a model and click on the 'ok' button, I am getting an 
error message that say 'BIOMD0000000327.xml not found'.

Also if I tried to import directly an 'SBML Model', it works most of the 
time fine. Once, I got an exception about a wrong level and version 
combination and iBiosim stopped/crashed but I am not sure what exactly I 
did and I could not reproduce it.


If I tried to use the 'save SBML model' menu item, I am getting an 
exception :

Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.ClassCastException: 
sbmleditor.SBML_Editor cannot be cast to gcm2sbml.gui.GCM2SBMLEditor
         at biomodelsim.BioSim.actionPerformed(BioSim.java:2401)

It seems that you are supporting mainly SBML level 3 core, I wanted to 
try to save a SBML model to see if I was able to save it as l2v4. Would 
that be possible in the current version of iBioSim ?


Thanks,
Nico
