Subject: Re: BUG: VHDL compiler does not compile the Boolean condition for "while" loop correctly (PR#6374)
Date: Wed Sep  2 04:52:22 2015

In order for this to work, the "free" variable is declared as a signal
with type std_logic. The VHDL compiler now adds it correctly as a
condition for the while loop. Closing.
