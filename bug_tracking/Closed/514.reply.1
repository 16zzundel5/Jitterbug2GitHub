I do not know what the difference is between what you did and what I am doing,
but this example still breaks things.  I have a fresh update (cvs update -A from
the top level.)  You may want to look at this again.  There must be something
wrong with the way the constraint is being handled with the flags on, because
this constraint rule should fail, but it does not!

I have checked in the skunky example in ./example/csp/jordi2wc.csp and tagged my
version of atacs with the name SOLVECSCERROR.  The command line I am using that
breaks things is:

atacs -mEmXmcmsmUmPmTmFmOmpya jordi2wc.csp


This will cause a ERROR:45: Unexpected end of line!
