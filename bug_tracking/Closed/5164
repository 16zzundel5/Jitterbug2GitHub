Subject: CHANGE: make transforms aware of interesting variables
Date: Tue, 5 Oct 2010 09:13:08 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

Any transform that can potentially remove a variable or change the  
timing of an assignment to a variable should be prevent interesting  
variables from being modified.

Local assignment propagation should not delete the prior assignment if  
it is to an interesting variable.
Remove (and pairwise) write before write should skip over variables  
that are interesting.
Remove unread variables should skip over variables that are interesting.
