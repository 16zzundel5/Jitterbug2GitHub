Subject: BUG: analysis tool incorrectly creates rules from components

Bug reported by: jeffrey.theisen@utah.edu

Description:
As I was trying to simulate my Host Interaction model I ran into some issues.  To simplify the model as I was working on it, I used two different components to make a hierachical model.  When I try running an ODE simulation I get an error saying The reb2sac program returned 255 as an exit value.  I investigated the issue some more and found that if I make a flattened sbml model I could see what was wrong.  Somehow, when flattening the model, the variables for my rules were not correctly created:

Where a rule should have said "tlr_activation_function(Adherent, C1__MG_309, C1__MG_309, C1__tlr_activation_constant)", the variables from the function were incorrectly entered as "tlr_activation_function(Adherent, MG_309, MG_309, C1__tlr_activation_constant)".  I found that if I went through all of my rules and added the necessary prefixes the all the variables, then the simulation would run just fine.
