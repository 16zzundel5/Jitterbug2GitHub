If a continuous variable shows dmv behavior in one/few of the simulation tr=
aces and if turns out that a rate assignment and a value assignment should =
be made on the same transition, then probably separate transitions(one for =
dmv assignment and other for rate assignment of same variable) should be cr=
eated which branch from the previous place.=
