Ten Reasons Why the Free World with The 
Leadership of America Must Boycott the 2008 
Olympic Games in Communist China
By Demetrius Klitou

1) Human rights are practically non-existent in Communist China 
Religious persecution, imprisonment and murder of non-violent political dissidents, torture, 
organ harvesting and sentences to hard labour are widespread. 

2) The lack of freedom of the press and safety risks for foreign reporters 
Many foreign websites are banned from being visited within China, foreign reporters are 
prohibited from interviewing anyone without previous permission from the government, and 
the content of all broadcasting is severely restricted. Foreign news media reporters have 
been arrested and sentenced to prison under vague and wide-reaching security laws.

3) The 1980 Olympic Games in Communist Russia were boycotted by 64 states, 
under the leadership of the U.S. 
Beijing is not any different from Moscow in 1980, which was also the capital of a 
Communist police state. 

4) Communist China constantly threatens to attack Taiwan
China's government passed a law that explicitly calls for military intervention in response to 
any intention by the democratic government of Taiwan to declare independence. Military 
manoeuvres indicate that the Communists' military is preparing to enforce this law.

5) Beijing has the most polluted air in the world 
Studies and satellites photos have proven that Beijing suffers from extremely high nitrogen 
dioxide levels, vitally dangerous to the health of the athletes.

6) China is plagued by widespread social, political, and economic unrest 
A surge in huge land grabs and forced evictions by the Chinese government for reasons of 
economic expansion and Olympic Games preparations have sparked thousands of protests. 
The government has murdered hundreds of protesters.

7) The Chinese have been bribing and threatening large numbers of members of the 
International Olympic Committee
A number of U.S. Representatives, for example, Congressman Tom Lantos, have stated this 
on national television.

8) A boycott has some potential to serve as a strategy to encourage human rights in 
China 
Only the greedy and foolish global elite think this is true the other way around. 

9) Holding the Olympic Games in Communist China contradicts the Olympic 
Charter 
The Olympic Charter defines the philosophy of Olympism as the "respect for universal 
fundamental ethical principles" and its goal of promoting "a peaceful society concerned with 
the preservation of human dignity." 

10) Don't repeat the errors of 1936 when Nazi Germany was allowed to host the 
Olympic Games 
The Olympic Games will give Communist China the same propaganda tool Nazi Germany 
enjoyed. Not since 1936 have the ideals of Olympics been so trampled upon.

Epoch Times Commentaries on the Chinese Communist Party - Part 9
The Chinese Communist Party, a Band of Scoundrels
Foreword
For over a century, the boisterous Communist movement has only=
 brought mankind 
war, poverty, brutality and dictatorship. With the collapse of=
 the Soviet Union 
and the Eastern European Communist Parties, this disastrous and=
 absurd drama 
finally entered its last stage by the end of the last century. No=
 one, from the 
ordinary citizens to the General Secretary of the Communist=
 Party, believes in 
the myth of Communism anymore. 
The Chinese Communist regime came into being due to neither=
 =93divine mandate=94 [1] 
nor democratic election. Today, with its ideology destroyed, the=
 legitimacy of 
its reign is facing an unprecedented challenge. 
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is unwilling to leave the=
 historical stage in 
obedience to history. Instead, it is using the ruthless methods=
 developed during 
decades of political campaigns to renew its search for legitimacy=
 and its 
attempt to revive its dead mandate. 
The CCP=92s policies of reform and opening up disguise a desperate=
 intention to 
maintain its totalitarian rule. The economic achievements earned=
 by the hard 
work of the Chinese people in the past twenty years did not=
 persuade the CCP to 
put down its butcher knife. Instead, the CCP co-opted these=
 achievements to 
validate its reign and to cover up and glamorize its consistent=
 scoundrel 
behavior. What is most terrifying is that the CCP is going all=
 out to try to 
destroy the moral foundation of the entire nation, attempting to=
 turn every 
Chinese national to various degrees into a scoundrel in order to=
 create an 
environment favorable for the CCP to =93advance with time.=94 
In the historical moment today, it is especially important for us=
 to understand 
clearly why the CCP acts like scoundrels and to discern its=
 criminal nature, so 
that the Chinese nation can achieve lasting stability and peace,=
 enter as soon 
as possible an era devoid of the CCP, and construct a future of=
 renewed national 
splendor. 
******************
I. The Scoundrel Nature of the CCP Has Never Changed 
Who Is the CCP=92s Reform for? 
Throughout history, whenever the CCP encountered crises, it would=
 demonstrate 
some traces of improvement, enticing people to develop illusions=
 about the CCP. 
Without exception, the illusions are shattered time and again.=
 Today, the CCP 
has pursued short-term benefits and in doing so produced a show=
 of economic 
prosperity that has once again persuaded the people to believe in=
 fantasies 
about the CCP. However, the fundamental conflicts between the=
 interest of the 
CCP and that of the nation and the people determine that this=
 false prosperity 
will not last. The =91reform=92 the CCP has promised has one purpose:=
 to maintain 
its reign. It is a lame reform, a change in surface but not in=
 substance. 
Underneath the lopsided development lies a great social crisis.=
 Once the crisis 
breaks out, the nation and the people will suffer once again. 
With the change of leadership, the new generation of CCP leaders=
 had no part in 
the Communist revolution, and therefore have less and less=
 prestige in managing 
the nation. Amidst the crisis of its legitimacy, the CCP=92s=
 protection of the 
Party=92s interests has increasingly become the basic guarantee for=
 maintaining 
the interests of individuals within the CCP. The CCP=92s nature is=
 unconstrained 
selfishness; to hope such a party might devote itself to=
 developing the country 
peacefully is wishful thinking. 
Let us look at what People=92s Daily, the mouthpiece of the CCP,=
 said in a front 
page story on July 12th, 2004: =93The historical dialectics have=
 taught the CCP 
members the following: Those things that should be changed must=
 change, 
otherwise deterioration will follow; those that should not be=
 changed must 
remain unchanged, otherwise it will lead to self destruction.=94 
What is it that should remain unchanged? The People=92s Daily=
 explains: =93The 
Party=92s basic line of =91one center, two basic points=92 must last=
 solidly for one 
hundred years without any vacillation.=94 [2] 
People don=92t necessarily understand what the =91center=92 and =91basic=
 points=92 stand 
for, but everyone knows that the Communist specter=92s=
 determination to maintain 
its collective interest and dictatorship never changes. Communism=
 has been 
defeated globally, and is doomed to become more and more=
 moribund. Nevertheless, 
the more corrupt a thing becomes the more destructive it becomes=
 during its 
dying struggle. To discuss democratic improvements with the=
 Communist Party is 
like asking a tiger for its skin. 
What Would China Do Without the Communist Party? 
As the CCP heads toward deterioration, people unexpectedly=
 discover that for 
decades the evil specter CCP has, with its ever changing roguish=
 means, 
instilled its elements into every aspect of ordinary people=92s=
 lives. 
At the time of Mao Zedong=92s death, so many Chinese cried bitterly=
 before Mao=92s 
portrait, wondering repeatedly, =93How can China continue without=
 Chairman Mao?=94 
Ironically, twenty years later, when the world is questioning the=
 political 
legitimacy of the Communist Party, the CCP has spread a new round=
 of propaganda, 
making people wonder again, "What would China do without the=
 Communist Party?=94 
In reality, the CCP=92s all-pervasive political control has so=
 deeply branded our 
culture and our mindsets that even the criteria with which we=
 judge the CCP have 
come from the CCP. If in the past the CCP controlled people by=
 instilling its 
elements into them, then the CCP has now come to harvest what it=
 sowed, since 
those things instilled in people=92s minds have been digested and=
 absorbed into 
their very cells. People think according to the CCP=92s logic and=
 put themselves 
in the CCP's shoes in judging right and wrong. Regarding the=
 CCP=92s killing of 
student protesters on June 4, 1989, some people said, =93If I were=
 Deng Xiaoping, 
I too would quell the protest with tanks.=94 In the persecution of=
 Falun Gong, 
some people are saying, "If I were Jiang Zemin, I too would=
 eliminate Falun 
Gong.=94 About the ban on free speech, some people are saying, "If=
 I were the CCP, 
I would do the same.=94 Truth and conscience have vanished, leaving=
 only the CCP=92s 
logic. This has been the consequence of the extremely vile and=
 ruthless methods 
used by the CCP. As long as the CCP can continually instill its=
 moral toxins 
into the people=92s minds, it can continue to gain energy to=
 sustain itself. 
"What would China do without the CCP?" This mode of thinking fits=
 precisely the 
CCP=92s desires of having people reason by its own logic. 
China came through her 5000-year history of civilization without=
 the CCP; no 
country in the world would stop social advancement because of the=
 fall of a 
particular regime. After decades of the CCP's rule, however,=
 people no longer 
recognize this fact. The CCP's prolonged propaganda has trained=
 people to think 
of the Party as their mother. The omnipresent CCP politics have=
 rendered people 
faint in thinking how to live their lives without the CCP. 
Without Mao Zedong, China did not fall; would China collapse=
 without the CCP!? 
Who Is the Real Source of Turmoil? 
Many people know and dislike the CCP's scoundrel behavior, and=
 loathe its 
struggles and deceptions. But they, at the same time, fear the=
 CCP=92s political 
movements and the resultant turmoil, and fear chaos will visit=
 China again. 
Thus, once the CCP threatens people with =93turmoil,=94 people fall=
 into a silent 
acceptance of the CCP=92s rule, feeling helpless in the face of the=
 CCP=92s despotic 
power. 
In reality, with its several million troops and armed police, the=
 CCP is the 
real source of turmoil. Ordinary citizens have neither the cause=
 nor the 
capability to initiate turmoil. Only the regressive CCP would be=
 so reckless as 
to bring the country into turmoil. =93Stability overrides=
 everything else=94 and 
=93Nipping the buds of all unstable elements=94=97these slogans have=
 become the 
theoretical basis for the CCP to suppress people. Who is the=
 biggest cause of 
instability in China? Is it not the CCP, who specializes in=
 tyranny? The CCP 
instigates turmoil, and then in turn uses the chaos it created to=
 coerce the 
people. This is a common behavior of all scoundrels. 
******************
II. Economic Development Is Sacrificed by the CCP 
Taking Credit for the Achievements of People=92s Hard Work 
The CCP=92s claim to legitimacy lies in the economic development=
 over the past 20 
some years. In reality, however, such a development was gradually=
 achieved by 
the Chinese people after the fetters of the CCP were slightly=
 relaxed and, 
therefore, has nothing to do with the CCP=92s own merit. The CCP=
 has, however, 
claimed this economic development as its own achievement, asking=
 people to be 
grateful for it. The CCP would hope people to believe that none=
 of these 
developments would have taken place without the CCP, while we all=
 know that many 
non-Communist countries have achieved faster economic growth a=
 long time ago. 
Having won Olympic gold medals, the athletes are required to=
 thank the Party. 
The Party did not hesitate to use the forged image of a =93great=
 nation of sports=94 
to eulogize its sagacious leadership. China suffered a great deal=
 in the SARS 
epidemic, but People's Daily reportedly said that China defeated=
 the virus 
=93relying on the Party's basic theory, basic line, basic=
 principle, and basic 
experience.=94 The launching of China=92s spaceship Shenzhou-V was=
 accomplished by 
the professionals of astronautic science and technology, but the=
 CCP used it as 
an evidence to prove that only the CCP could lead the Chinese=
 people to enter 
the rank of powerful countries in the world. As for China=92s=
 hosting of the 2008 
Olympic Games, what was in reality an =93olive branch=94 given by=
 Western countries 
to encourage China to improve its human rights, the CCP uses to=
 burnish its 
claims to legitimacy and to use as a pretext for suppressing the=
 Chinese people. 
China=92s =93great market potential,=94 which is sought after by=
 foreign investors, 
stems from the consumption power of China=92s population of 1.3=
 billion. The CCP 
usurps credit for this potential, and turns it into a keen weapon=
 used to coerce 
western society into cooperating with the CCP=92s rule. 
The CCP attributes anything bad to reactionary forces and the=
 ulterior motives 
of individuals, while crediting everything good to the Party=
 leadership. The CCP 
will make use of every single achievement to make its claim to=
 legitimacy more 
attractive. Even the wrongdoings that the CCP commits can be=
 turned into 
something good to serve its purposes. For example, when the truth=
 about the 
rampant spreading of AIDS could no longer be covered up, the CCP=
 suddenly 
created a new identity. It carefully mobilized its propaganda=
 machine, utilizing 
everyone from well-known actors to Party secretaries in order to=
 portray the 
prime culprit, the CCP, as a blessing for patients, a destroyer=
 of AIDS, and a 
challenger to disease. In dealing with such a serious=
 life-and-death issue, all 
the CCP could think of was how to use the issue to glorify=
 itself. Only as 
vicious a scoundrel as the CCP is capable of such ruthless=
 behaviors as brazen 
or underhanded taking of credits and an utter disregard for human=
 life. 
Economic Disadvantage Caused by Short-Sighted Behaviours 
Facing a serious =93legitimacy crisis,=94 the CCP carried out the=
 policies of reform 
and openness in the 1980=92s in order to maintain its rule. Its=
 eagerness for a 
quick success has placed China in a disadvantageous position=
 termed by 
economists as the =93curse of the latecomer.=94 
The concepts of =93curse of the latecomer=94 or =93latecomer advantage=94=
 refer to the 
fact that underdeveloped countries, which set out late for=
 development, can 
imitate the developed countries in many aspects. The imitation=
 can take two 
forms: imitating the social system, or imitating the=
 technological and 
industrial models. Imitating a social system is usually=
 difficult, since a 
system reform would endanger the vested interests of some social=
 or political 
groups; thus underdeveloped countries are inclined to imitate=
 developed 
countries=92 technologies. Although technological imitation can=
 generate 
short-term economic growth, it may result in many hidden risks or=
 even failure 
in long-term development. 
It is precisely the =93curse to the latecomer,=94 a path to failure,=
 that the CCP 
has followed. Over the past two decades, China=92s =93technological=
 imitation=94 has 
led to some achievements, which have been taken by the CCP to its=
 own advantage 
in order to prove its =93legitimacy=94 and continue to resist=
 political reform that 
would undermine the CCP=92s own interests. Thus, the long-term=
 interests of the 
nation have been sacrificed. 
A Painful Cost for the CCP=92s Economic Development 
While the CCP constantly brags about its economic advancement, in=
 reality, 
China=92s economy today ranks lower in the world than during the=
 Qianlong=92s reign 
(1711-1799) in the Qing Dynasty. During the Qianlong period,=
 China=92s GDP 
accounted for 51 percent of the world=92s total. In the early years=
 after Sun 
Yat-sen founded the Republic of China (Kuomintang or KMT period),=
 China=92s GDP 
accounted for 27 percent of the world=92s total. By 1923, the=
 percentage dropped, 
but still was as high as 12 percent. In 1949, when the CCP took=
 control, the 
percentage was 5.7, but in 2003, China=92s GDP was less than 4=
 percent of the 
world=92s total. In contrast to the economic downsizing during the=
 KMT period that 
was caused by several decades of war, the continuing economic=
 decline during the 
CCP=92s reign occurred during peaceful times. 
Today, in order to legitimize its power, the CCP was eager for=
 quick successes 
and instant benefits. The crippled economic reform that the CCP=
 launched to 
safeguard its interests has cost the country dearly. The rapid=
 economic growth 
in the past twenty years is, to a large extent, built on the=
 excessive use or 
even waste of resources, and has been gained at the cost of=
 environmental 
destruction. A considerable portion of China=92s GDP is achieved by=
 sacrificing 
the opportunities of future generations. In 2003, China=
 contributed less than 4 
percent to the world economy, but its consumption of steel,=
 cement and other 
materials amounted to one third of the total global=
 consumption.[3] 
From the 1980=92s to the end of the 1990=92s, desertification in=
 China increased 
from a little over 1000 to 2460 square kilometres. The per-capita=
 arable land 
also decreased from about 2 mu in 1980 to 1.43 mu in 2003 [4].=
 The widespread 
upsurge of land enclosure for development has led China to lose=
 100 million mu 
of arable land in just a few years time. The confiscated land,=
 however, has as a 
use rate as low as 43 percent. Currently, the total amount of=
 wastewater 
discharge is 43.95 billion tons, exceeding the environmental=
 capacity by 82 
percent. In the seven major river systems, 40.9 percent of the=
 water is not 
suitable for drinking by humans or livestock. Seventy-five=
 percent of the lakes 
are polluted so as to produce various degrees of=
 eutrophication.[5] The 
conflicts between man and nature in China have never been as=
 intense as they are 
today. Neither China nor the world can withstand such unhealthy=
 growth. Deluded 
by the superficial resplendence of high rises and mansions,=
 people are unaware 
of the impending ecological crisis. Once the time comes for=
 nature to take 
revenge upon human beings, however, it will bring disastrous=
 consequences to the 
Chinese nation. 
In comparison, Russia, after abandoning Communism, has carried=
 out economic and 
political reforms at the same time. After experiencing a short=
 period of agony, 
it has embarked on a rapid development. From 1999 to 2003,=
 Russia=92s GDP 
increased by a total of 29.9 percent. The living standard of its=
 residents has 
been significantly improved. The Western business circles have=
 begun not only to 
discuss the =93Russian economic phenomenon,=94 but have also begun to=
 invest in 
Russia, the new hotspot, on a large scale. Russia=92s ranking among=
 the most 
attractive nations for investment has jumped from 17th in 2002 to=
 8th in 2003, 
becoming one of the world=92s top ten popular nations for=
 investment for the first 
time. 
Even India, a country that in the minds of most Chinese is=
 poverty-stricken and 
full of ethnic conflicts, has enjoyed a significantly expedited=
 development and 
achieved an economic growth rate of 7-8 percent per year since=
 its economic 
reforms in 1991. India has a relatively complete legal system in=
 a market 
economy, a healthy financial system, a well-developed democratic=
 system, and a 
stable public mentality. It has been recognized by the=
 international community 
as a country of great development potential. 
On the contrary, the CCP only engages in economic reform without=
 making 
political reform. The false appearance of an economy that=
 flourishes in the 
short run, which created an illusion of the socialist system, has=
 hindered the 
natural =93evolution of social systems.=94 It is this incomplete=
 reform that has 
caused an increasing imbalance in the Chinese society and=
 sharpened social 
conflicts. The financial gains achieved by the people are not=
 systematically 
protected by a stable legal and constitutional system.=
 Furthermore, in the 
process of privatizing the state-owned properties, the CCP=92s=
 power-holders have 
utilized their positions to fill their own pockets. 
CCP=92s Repeated Cheating of Peasants 
CCP relied on peasants to gain power; the rural residents in the=
 CCP-controlled 
areas in the early stage of its buildup devoted all they had to=
 the CCP. But 
after the CCP obtained control of the country, peasants have=
 experienced severe 
discrimination. 
After the CCP established the government, it set up a very unfair=
 system: the 
residential registration system. The system forcefully classifies=
 people into 
rural and non-rural populations, creating an unreasonable=
 separation and 
opposition within the country. Peasants have no medical=
 insurance, no 
unemployment welfare, no retirement pensions and cannot take=
 loans from banks. 
Peasants are the most impoverished class in China, but also the=
 class carrying 
the heaviest tax burden. Peasants need to pay a mandatory=
 provident fund, public 
welfare fund, administrative management fund, extra education=
 fee, birth control 
fee, militia organization and training fee, country road=
 construction fee and 
military service compensation fee. Besides all these fees, they=
 also have to 
sell part of the grains they produce at a flat rate to the state=
 as a mandatory 
requirement, and pay agriculture tax, land tax, special local=
 produce tax, and 
butchery tax in addition to numerous other levies. In contrast,=
 the non-rural 
population does not pay these fees and taxes. 
In the beginning of 2004, China=92s Premier Wen Jiabao issued a=
 =93No. 1 Document,=94 
stating that rural China was facing the most difficult time since=
 the economic 
reform in 1978. Income for most peasants had stagnated or even=
 declined. They 
had become poorer, and the income gap between urban and rural=
 residents 
continued to widen. 
In a tree farm in eastern Sichuan province, upper level=
 authorites distributed 
500,000 yuan (approximately US$ 60,500) for a reforestation=
 project. The leaders 
at the tree farm first put 200,000 yuan in their own pocket, and=
 then allocated 
the remaining 300,000 yuan to tree planting. But as the money was=
 taken away 
when passing through each level of the government, very little=
 was left in the 
end for local peasants who did the actual tree planting. The=
 government did not 
need to worry that the peasants would refuse to work on the=
 project because of 
inadequate funding. The peasants were so impoverished that they=
 would work for 
very little money. For this same reason products made in China=
 are so cheap. 
Using Economic Interests to Pressure Western Countries 
Many people believe that trade with China will promote human=
 rights, freedom of 
speech and democratic reform in China. After more than 20 years,=
 it is clear 
that this assumption is only wishful thinking. A comparison of=
 the principles 
for doing business in China and the West provides a common=
 example. The fairness 
and transparency of Western societies are replaced by personal=
 relations, 
bribery and embezzlement in China. Many Western corporations have=
 become 
culpable by further exacerbating China=92s corruption; some=
 companies even help 
the CCP hide its human rights violations and persecution of its=
 own people. 
The CCP typically behaves like a scoundrel by playing the=
 economic card in 
foreign diplomacy. Whether China=92s aircraft manufacturing=
 contract is given to 
France or the U.S. depends on which country keeps quiet on CCP=92s=
 human rights 
issues. Many Western businessmen and politicians are driven and=
 controlled by 
economic profits from China. Some Information technology=
 companies from North 
America have supplied specialized products to the CCP for=
 blocking the internet. 
Some Internet websites have, in order to gain entry to the=
 Chinese market, 
agreed to censor themselves so as to filter out information=
 disliked by the CCP. 

According to data from China=92s Ministry of Commerce, by the end=
 of April 2004, 
China has seen a total US$ 990 billion of foreign investment in=
 various 
contracts. The =93huge blood transfusion=94 to the CCP=92s economy from=
 foreign 
capital is apparent. But in the process of investment, foreign=
 capital did not 
bring the concept of democracy, freedom and human rights to the=
 Chinese people. 
The CCP capitalizes in its propaganda on the unconditional=
 cooperation by 
foreign investors and foreign governments and the flattery of=
 some countries. By 
making use of China=92s superficial economic prosperity, the CCP=
 officials have 
become extremely adept at colluding with businesses to divide=
 state wealth and 
block political reforms. 
******************
III. The CCP=92s Brainwashing Techniques: From =93Brazen=94 to=
 =93Delicate=94 
People are often heard to say, =93I know the CCP lied too often in=
 the past, but 
this time it is telling the truth.=94 Ironically, in retrospect,=
 this is what 
people would say each time after the CCP made a grave mistake in=
 the past. This 
reflects the ability the CCP has acquired over the decades to use=
 lies to fool 
its people. 
People have developed some resistance to the CCP=92s tall tales; in=
 response, the 
CCP=92s fabrication and propaganda have become more =93delicate=94 and=
 =93professional.=94 
Evolving from the slogan-style propaganda of the past, the CCP=92s=
 lies have 
become more =93gradual=94 and =93subtle.=94 Particularly under the=
 conditions of the 
information blockade the CCP has erected around China, it makes=
 up stories based 
on partial facts to mislead the public, which is even more=
 detrimental and 
deceptive than tall tales. 
Chinascope, an English language journal, carried an article in=
 October, 2004 
that analyzes cases whereby the CCP uses more =93delicate=94 means to=
 fabricate lies 
in order to cover up the truth. When SARS broke out in mainland=
 China in 2003, 
the outside world suspected that China had hidden information=
 about the 
epidemic, and yet the CCP repeatedly refused to acknowledge it.=
 To find out if 
the CCP had been truthful about its report on SARS, the author of=
 the article 
read all 400-plus reports on SARS from the beginning to April=
 2003 on the Xinhua 
website. These reports told the following story: As soon as SARS=
 appeared, 
governments at central and local levels had mobilized experts to=
 give timely 
treatment to the patients who later were discharged from=
 hospitals upon 
recovery; in response to trouble-makers=92 incitement of rushed=
 shopping for 
stock-up in order to avoid having to go out when the disease is=
 widespread, the 
government had wasted no time to stop rumors and taken steps to=
 prevent their 
spread, so the social order had been effectively ensured;=
 although a very small 
number of anti-China forces groundlessly suspected a cover-up by=
 the Chinese 
government, most countries and people did not believe these=
 rumors; the upcoming 
Guangzhou Trade Fair would have the largest participation ever=
 from businesses 
around the world; tourists from overseas confirmed that it was=
 safe to travel in 
China; experts from the World Health Organization, in particular,=
 stated in 
public that the Chinese government had been forthcoming in=
 cooperating and 
taking appropriate measures in dealing with SARS, so that there=
 should be no 
problems; and specialists had given the go-ahead [after over 20=
 days delay] to 
Guangdong province for field inspection. These 400-plus articles=
 gave the public 
including the author an impression that the CCP had been quite=
 transparent 
during these four months and responsible to the people=92s health,=
 and made the 
people disbelieve that the CCP could have hidden anything.=
 However, on April 20, 
2003, the Information Office of the State Council announced in=
 its press 
conference that SARS had indeed broken out in China and thus=
 indirectly admitted 
that the government had been covering up the epidemics. Only then=
 did this 
author see the truth and understand the brazen and deceptive=
 methods employed by 
the CCP. 
On the general election in Taiwan, the CCP, using the same=
 =93gradual=94 and 
=93patiently guiding=94 approach, suggests to people that a=
 presidential election 
would lead to disasters: a surge in the suicide rate, a collapse=
 in the stock 
markets, an increase in =93weird diseases,=94 mental disorders,=
 out-migration of the 
island inhabitants, family feuds, a callous attitude towards=
 life, a depressed 
market, indiscriminate shooting, protests and demonstrations, a=
 siege on the 
presidential building, social unrest, political farce, and so on.=
 The CCP filled 
the heads of the people in mainland China with these ideas on a=
 daily basis in 
an attempt to let the people conclude for themselves: =93all of=
 these are the 
disastrous results of an election=94 and =93we should never ever hold=
 a democratic 
election.=94 
On the issue of Falun Gong, the CCP has displayed an even higher=
 level of skill 
with deceptions meant to frame Falun Gong. The CCP=92s staged shows=
 have been so 
vivid and kept coming one after another. No wonder so many=
 Chinese have been 
fooled. The CCP=92s craftiness has been so deceptive that the=
 victims of its 
deception willingly believe in the CCP=92s lies and think that they=
 have the 
truth. 
The CCP=92s cheating ability in its brainwashing propaganda over=
 the past decades 
has become more =93delicate=94 and =93subtle,=94 which is a natural=
 extension of its 
deceptive and shameless nature. 
******************
IV. The CCP=92s Hypocrisy in Human Rights 
From Seeking Democracy for the Sake of Power to Dictatorial Rule=
 and Hypocrisy 
in Human Rights 
=93In a democratic nation, sovereignty should lie in the hands of=
 the people, 
which is in line with the principles of heaven and earth. If a=
 nation claims to 
be democratic and yet sovereignty does not rest with its people,=
 that is 
definitely not on the right track and can only be regarded as a=
 deviation, and 
this nation is not a democratic nation=85 how could democracy be=
 possible without 
ending the Party rule and without a popular election? Return=
 people=92s rights to 
people! =94 
You may take the above as a quotation from an article written by=
 enemies 
overseas slamming the CCP; but you are wrong. The above statement=
 is taken from 
an article run by Xinhua Daily, a CCP newspaper, on September 27,=
 1945. 
The CCP that had trumpeted =93popular election=94 and demanded=
 =93returning people=92s 
rights to people=94 has been treating =93popular suffrage=94 as taboo=
 since it usurped 
power. The people who are supposed to be =93the masters and owners=
 of the state=94 
have no rights whatsoever to make their own decisions. No words,=
 not even 
=93roguish,=94 would be sufficient to describe the CCP=92s nature and=
 what the CCP has 
done to its people. 
If you fancy that what=92s gone is gone and the evil cult of the=
 CCP that has 
flourished on killing and ruled the nation with lies will now=
 start reforming 
itself and becoming benevolent and be truly willing to =93return=
 people=92s rights 
to people,=94 you are wrong again. Let us hear what People=92s Daily,=
 the CCP=92s 
mouthpiece, has to say on November 23rd, 2004, 60 years after the=
 above public 
statement: =93A steadfast control of ideology is the essential=
 ideological and 
political foundation for consolidating the Party=92s rule.=94 
Recently, the CCP proposed a so-called new =93Three No Principle,=94=
 [6] the first 
of which is =93Development with no debates.=94 The CCP=92s real purpose=
 is not 
=93development=94 but to emphasize =93no debates,=94 establishing =93one=
 voice, one hall.=94 

When asked by the renowned CBS correspondent Mike Wallace in 2000=
 why China has 
not conducted popular elections, Jiang Zemin responded, =93The=
 Chinese people are 
way too low in education.=94 
However, as early as February 25, 1939, the CCP cried out in its=
 Xinhua Daily, 
=93They (the Kuomintang) think that democratic politics in China=
 are not to be 
realized today, but some years later. They hope that democratic=
 politics should 
wait until the knowledge and education levels of the Chinese=
 people reach those 
of bourgeois democratic countries in Europe and America=85=85 but,=
 only under the 
democratic system will it become easier to educate and train the=
 people.=94 
And the hypocritical difference between what Xinhua said in 1939=
 and what Jiang 
Zemin said in 2000 reflects the true picture of the CCP=92s roguish=
 nature. 
After the Tiananmen Massacre in 1989, the CCP reentered the world=
 stage carrying 
a miserable human rights record. History gave the CCP a chance to=
 choose: Either 
it should learn to respect its people and truly improve human=
 rights; or it 
could continue to abuse human rights inside China while=
 pretending to the 
outside world to respect human rights in order to evade=
 international 
condemnation. 
Unfortunately, the CCP, consistent with its hypocritical nature,=
 chose the 
second path without hesitation. It sustained and gathered=
 together a large 
number of dishonest talents in scientific and religious fields=
 who are 
specifically assigned to put up deceptive propaganda overseas and=
 trumpet the 
CCP=92s progress in human rights. It concocted a range of=
 unjustifiable rights 
fallacies such as =93the survival right,=94 or rights to shelter and=
 food. (When 
people are hungry, do they not have the right to speak? Even if=
 the hungry 
cannot speak, would it be allowed for those who have eaten their=
 fill to speak 
for the hungry?) It even tried to deceive the Chinese people and=
 western 
democracies by repeatedly manipulating the game of human rights=
 and had the 
audacity to say =93the present is the best period for China=92s human=
 rights=94. 
Article 35 of China=92s Constitution stipulates that citizens of=
 the People=92s 
Republic of China have the freedoms of expression, publication,=
 assembly, 
association, protest, and demonstration. The CCP is simply=
 playing a word game. 
Tens of millions of Falun Gong practitioners have been deprived=
 of their rights 
of conscience, speech, publication, and assembly. They do not=
 have the right to 
defend themselves, and even their appeal to higher authorities is=
 considered 
illegal. On more than one occasion, some civilian groups have=
 applied to 
demonstrate in Beijing. The government, instead of giving its=
 approval, arrested 
the applicants. The =93one state, two systems=94 policy for Hong Kong=
 affirmed by 
CCP=92s constitution is also a trap set up by the communist rulers=
 for the British 
government and the people in Hong Kong. The CCP talks about no=
 change in Hong 
Kong for 50 years, and yet it has tried to change the two systems=
 into one by 
attempting to pass tyrannical legislation, Basic Law Article 23,=
 within just 
five years. [7] 
The new sinister ploy employed by the CCP is to use the fake=
 =93relaxation in 
speech=94 to cover up the nature of its monitoring and control. The=
 Chinese now 
appear to speak their minds more freely and, besides, the=
 internet has made news 
travel faster. So the CCP openly claims that it now allows=
 freedom of speech, 
and quite a number of people think so too. But this is all=
 untrue. It is not 
that the CCP has become benevolent, rather, the Party could not=
 stop social 
development and technological advance. Let us look at the role=
 the CCP is 
playing regarding the internet: It is blocking websites,=
 filtering information, 
monitoring chat rooms, controlling emails, and incriminating net=
 users. 
Everything it is doing is regressive in nature. Today, with the=
 help of some 
capitalists who disregard human rights and conscience, the CCP=92s=
 police have 
been equipped with the high-tech devices by which they are able=
 to monitor every 
move the net users make inside a patrol car. When we look at the=
 indecency of 
the CCP=97its conduct of evils deeds in broad daylight=97in the=
 context of the 
global movement toward democratic freedom, how can we expect it=
 to make any 
progress in human rights? The CCP itself said it all: =93It loosens=
 up to the 
outside but tightens up internally.=94 The CCP=92s immoral nature has=
 never changed. 

To create a good image for itself at the UN Commission on Human=
 Rights, in 2004 
the CCP staged an array of events to severely punish the abuse of=
 human rights. 
These events, however, are for foreigners=92 eyes only and have no=
 substance. That 
is because in China the biggest human rights abuser is the CCP=
 itself as well as 
its former General Secretary Jiang Zemin, former secretary of the=
 Political and 
Judiciary Commission Luo Gan, the minister Zhou Yongkang, and the=
 deputy 
minister Liu Jing of the Ministry of Public Security. Relying=
 upon these people 
to punish human rights abuse is like asking robbers to capture=
 thieves. 
An analogy could be made to a serial rapist who, when hidden from=
 public view, 
used to assault ten girls in a day. Then, there are too many=
 people around, so 
he can assault only one girl in front of the crowd. Can the=
 rapist be said to 
have changed for the better? His going from assaults behind the=
 scenes to raping 
in public only proves that the rapist is even more base and=
 shameless than 
before. The nature of the serial rapist has not changed at all;=
 what has changed 
is that it is no longer as easy for him to commit the crime. 
The CCP is just like this serial rapist. The CCP=92s dictatorial=
 nature and its 
instinctive fear of losing power determine that it will not=
 respect people=92s 
rights. The human, material, and financial resources used to=
 beautify its human 
rights record have far exceeded its efforts in the true=
 improvement of human 
rights. The plaguing of China by the communist rogues has been=
 the biggest 
misfortune for the Chinese people. 
Dress Up to Commit Scoundrel Deeds Using the Law As a Disguise 
To protect the gains of special-interest groups, the CCP has on=
 the one hand 
torn up their previous fa=E7ade and completely abandoned the=
 workers, peasants, 
and the populace, and on the other hand with time advanced their=
 deceitful and 
scoundrel means as more and more human rights abuses of the CCP=
 are exposed to 
the international community. The CCP has used popular vocabulary=
 such as =93the 
rule of law,=94 =93market,=94 =93for the people,=94 and =93reform=94 to confuse=
 people=92s 
minds. The CCP did not change its evil scoundrel nature even if=
 it dresses 
itself up in a =93Western-style suit.=94 It is just more misleading=
 and deceiving 
than the CCP =93in a Mao suit.=94 In George Orwell=92s Animal Farm=
 (1945), the pigs 
learned to stand and walk on two legs. The newly acquired skill=
 gave the pigs a 
new image, but did not change their pig nature. 
A. Making Laws and Regulations in Violation of the Chinese=
 Constitution 
These unconstitutional laws and regulations are passed on to law=
 enforcement 
personnel at various levels as =93the legal basis.=94 The goal is to=
 assail the 
people=92s efforts to fight against persecution, gain freedom, and=
 uphold human 
rights. 
B. Non-political Problems Are Handled with Political Means 
An ordinary social problem would be elevated to the height of=
 =93competing with 
the Party for the masses,=94 =93bringing demise to the Party and the=
 country,=94 
=93insurgence,=94 and =93enemy forces.=94 A non-political issue would=
 intentionally be 
politicized, so that the CCP could use political movements as a=
 propaganda tool 
to incite people=92s hatred. 
C. Political Problems Are Handled with Non-political Means 
The CCP=92s latest ploy to attack pro-democratic personnel and 
independent-thinking intellectuals is to set up =93traps=94 in order=
 to imprison 
them. Such =93traps=94 include false accusations of civil offenses=
 such as 
prostitution and tax evasion. This is done with a low profile to=
 avoid 
condemnation by outside groups. These crimes, which are enough to=
 ruin the 
reputations of the accused, are also used to humiliate the=
 victims in public. 
The only change to the CCP=92s scoundrel nature, if any, is that it=
 has become 
even more disgraceful and inhuman. 
The Hostage Culture of Scoundrels=97Holding Over One Billion People=
 as Hostage 
Imagine that a licentious criminal broke into a home and raped a=
 girl. At the 
trial, this criminal defended himself by arguing that he did not=
 kill the victim 
since he was busy raping her. Because killing is worse than=
 raping and since he 
did not kill the victim, he is not only innocent but should also=
 be released 
immediately. People should also praise him for only raping but=
 not killing. 
This logic sounds ridiculous. However, at this very time, the=
 CCP=92s logic in 
defense of its Tiananmen Massacre on June 4th in, 1989 is exactly=
 the same as 
that of the above criminal. The CCP has argued that the=
 =93suppression of 
students=94 avoided a potential =93internal disorder=94 in China. As a=
 way to prevent 
an =93internal disorder,=94 the =93suppression of students=94 was thus=
 justified. 
What does it mean when a criminal questions the judge in court,=
 =93Raping or 
killing, which one is better=94? It can only indicate how shameless=
 the criminal 
is. Similarly, in the issue of the Tiananmen Massacre, the CCP=
 and its cohorts 
did not reflect on whether it is guilty of killing. Instead, they=
 asked the 
international society which one is better: =93Suppression of=
 students or internal 
disorder that may lead to civil war?=94 
The CCP is in control of the entire state machine and all means=
 of propaganda. 
In other words, the 1.3 billion Chinese people are held hostage=
 by the CCP. With 
the 1.3 billion hostages in hand, the CCP could always argue with=
 its =93hostage 
theory=94 that if it does not suppress a certain group of people,=
 the whole nation 
will be in turmoil or disaster. Using this as an excuse, the CCP=
 could suppress 
any individual or group at will, and its suppression could always=
 be justified. 
Given such deceitful arguments and fallacious reasoning, is there=
 any worse 
scoundrel more shameless in the world than the CCP? 
Carrots Plus Stick=97from Bestowing =93Freedom=94 to Escalating=
 Suppression 
Many Chinese people feel that they enjoy more =93freedom=94 now than=
 before, so they 
hold out a hope for the prospect of the CCP=92s improvement. As a=
 matter of fact, 
the degree of freedom people are =93bestowed=94 depends highly on the=
 CCP=92s sense of 
crisis. The CCP would do anything to maintain the collective=
 interests of the 
Party, including giving so-called democracy, freedom or human=
 rights to the 
people. 
However, under the CCP=92s leadership, the so-called =93freedom=94=
 bestowed by the CCP 
was not protected by any legislation. Such =93freedom=94 is purely a=
 tool to benumb 
and control people in the guise of following the international=
 trend toward 
democracy. In essence, this =93freedom=94 is in an irreconcilable=
 conflict with the 
CCP=92s interest in dictatorship. Once such a conflict is so=
 activated as to be 
beyond the CCP=92s tolerance level, the CCP could take back all the=
 =93freedom=94 
instantly. In the history of the CCP, there were several periods=
 during which 
speech was relatively free, with each followed by a strictly=
 controlled period. 
Such cyclic patterns course throughout the history of the CCP,=
 demonstrating the 
CCP=92s scoundrel nature. 
In today=92s Internet era, if you visit the CCP=92s official Xinhua=
 website or the 
People=92s Daily online, you will find that indeed quite a few=
 reports there 
contain negative information about China. This is because, first,=
 there is too 
much bad news in rapid circulation in China these days, and the=
 news agency has 
to report these stories in order to stay credible. Second, the=
 standpoint of 
such reports coincides with the CCP=92s interest, i.e., =93minor=
 criticism offers 
great help.=94 The reports would always attribute the cause of bad=
 news to certain 
individuals, having nothing to do with the Party, while crediting=
 the CCP=92s 
leadership for any solution. The CCP controls skillfully what to=
 report or not, 
how much to report, and whether to have Chinese media or the=
 CCP-controlled 
overseas media report it. The CCP is a proficient at manipulating=
 bad news into 
something that can achieve the desired result of winning people=92s=
 hearts. Many 
youth in mainland China feel that the CCP now offers a good=
 degree of freedom of 
speech, and thus have hopes for and are appreciative of the CCP.=
 They are 
victims of the =93refined=94 strategies of the scoundrel media.=
 Moreover, by 
creating a chaotic situation in the Chinese society and then=
 giving it some 
media exposure, the CCP could threaten people that only the CCP=92s=
 power could 
control such a chaotic society and force people to endorse the=
 CCP=92s rule. 
Therefore, we should not mistakenly think the CCP has changed by=
 itself even if 
we see some benign intention by the CCP of improving human=
 rights. In history 
when the CCP struggled to overthrow KMT=92s government, it=
 pretended to be 
fighting for democracy for the nation. The CCP=92s scoundrel nature=
 determines 
that any promise by the CCP is not reliable. 
******************
V. Various Aspects of the CCP=92s Scoundrel Nature 
Selling out the Nation=92s Land out of Vanity=97Using The Name of=
 National Unity to 
Betray the Country 
=93We must liberate Taiwan=94 and =93Unify Taiwan=94 have been the CCP=92s=
 propaganda 
slogans over the past few decades. By means of this propaganda,=
 the CCP acted 
like a nationalist and patriot. Does the CCP truly care about the=
 integrity of 
the nation=92s territory? Not at all! Taiwan was merely an historic=
 problem caused 
by the struggle between the CCP and KMT, and it was a means that=
 the CCP used to 
strike at its opponent and win people=92s support. 
In the early days when the CCP set up the =93Chinese Soviet=94 during=
 the 
Nationalist reign, the Clause 14 of its Constitution stated that=
 =93any ethnic 
groups or any provinces inside China can claim independence.=94 In=
 order to comply 
with the Soviet Union, the CCP=92s slogan back then was =93To protect=
 the Soviet.=94 
During the Sino-Japanese War, the supreme goal of the CCP was to=
 take the 
opportunity to increase itself rather than fight against Japanese=
 intruders. In 
1945 the Soviet Red Army entered Northeast China and committed=
 robbery, murder, 
and rape, but the CCP did not utter a word of disapproval.=
 Similarly, when the 
Soviet Union supported Outer Mongolia to become independent from=
 China, the CCP 
was once again silent. 
At the end of 1999, the CCP and Russia signed the China-Russia=
 Boarder Survey 
Agreement, in which the CCP accepted all the unequal agreements=
 between the Qing 
Dynasty and Russia made more than 100 years ago, selling out over=
 one million 
square kilometers of land to Russia, an area as large as several=
 dozen Taiwans. 
In 2004, the CCP and Russia signed a China-Russia Eastern Border=
 Supplemental 
Agreement and reportedly lost sovereignty of half of the Heixiazi=
 Island in 
Heilongjiang province to Russia again. 
Regarding other border issues such as the Nansha Islands and=
 Diaoyu Island, the 
CCP does not care at all since these issues do not impact the=
 CCP=92s power. The 
CCP has made a fanfare of =93Unifying Taiwan,=94 which was merely a=
 smoke screen and 
scoundrel means for overcoming domestic conflict in the name of=
 nationalism. 
The Political Thugs without Morality 
A government should always be monitored. In democratic countries,=
 the separation 
of powers plus the freedoms of speech and the press are good=
 mechanisms for 
surveillance. Religious belief provides the self-restraint of=
 morality. 
The CCP promotes atheism; hence, there is no divine nature to=
 restrain morally 
its behavior. The CCP runs on dictatorship, hence there is no law=
 to restrain it 
politically. As a result, the CCP is totally reckless and=
 unrestrained when it 
plays out its indecency and scoundrel-nature. How does the CCP=
 speak to the 
people regarding the issue of who will monitor it? =93Self=
 restraint!=94 This is the 
slogan the CCP has used to deceive the people for decades. From=
 the =93Self 
Criticism=94 in earlier times to =93self surveillance,=94=
 =93self-perfecting the Party=92s 
leadership,=94 to the recent =93self-enhancing the Party=92s governing=
 capacity.=94 The 
CCP emphasizes the super power that it has for so-called =93self=
 improvement.=94 The 
CCP does not just say it but actually takes action, establishing=
 =93The Central 
Disciplinary Inspection Committee=94 and =93the Office for Appeals=94=
 and the like. 
These organizations are merely =93flower vases=94 that confuse and=
 mislead. 
Without moral and legal restraint, the CCP=92s =93self-improvment=94 is=
 equal to the 
traditional Chinese saying of =93demons emerging from one=92s own=
 heart.=94 It is only 
the excuse the CCP uses to refuse external surveillance and=
 refuse to lift a ban 
on a free press and the forming of free political parties.=
 Political thugs use 
this delusion to fool the people and to protect the CCP=92s=
 legitimacy and the 
interests of the ruling group. 
The CCP is expert at playing the political thug. =93The People=92s=
 Democratic 
Dictatorship,=94 =93Democratic Centralism,=94 =93Political Consultation=94=
 and so on are 
all deceptive means. Except for the =93Dictatorship,=94 they are all=
 lies. 
Employ Conspiracy to Forge Images of Being Anti-Japanese and=
 Anti-Terrorist 
The CCP has always claimed to have led the Chinese people in=
 defeating the 
Japanese invaders. But abundant historical archives expose that=
 the CCP 
intentionally avoided battles in the Sino-Japanese War. To the=
 contrary, the CCP 
only hampered the anti-Japanese effort by taking the opportunity=
 of the KMT=92s 
involvement in the war to increase its own power. 
The only major battles the CCP fought were the =93Pingxing Pass=
 Battle=94 and the 
=93Hundred Regiment Battle,=94 both of which took place in northern=
 China. In the 
first battle, the CCP offered not at all the leadership and main=
 force it has 
claimed; the CCP troops merely ambushed the Japanese=
 supplementary army. As for 
the second battle, the inner CCP circle believed that=
 participating in it 
violated its own strategic policies. After these two battles, Mao=
 and his CCP 
armies did not engage in any serious battles, nor did they=
 produce any 
Sino-Japanese War heroes like Dong Cunrui during the war with the=
 KMT in 1948 
and Huang Jiguang during the Korean-American war.[8] Only a small=
 number of 
high-level military commanders of the CCP died on the=
 anti-Japanese 
battleground. Until today, the CCP cannot even publish a figure=
 for its 
casualties during the Sino-Japanese War, nor can one find many=
 memorials in 
China=92s vast territory for heroes in the Sino-Japanese War. 
At the time the CCP established a =93Border Region Government=94 in=
 Shaanxi, Gansu, 
and Ningxia provinces away from the battlefront. Using today=92s=
 nomenclature, the 
CCP was conducting =93one country two systems,=94 or =93two Chinas=94=
 inside China. 
Although the CCP=92s commanders did not lack passion in resisting=
 the Japanese, 
the CCP=92s high-level officials were not sincere in fighting the=
 Sino-Japanese 
War, but instead took measures to protect their energy and use=
 the war as an 
opportunity to develop themselves. When China and Japan resumed=
 diplomatic 
relations in 1972, Mao Zedong let slip the truth to the Japanese=
 Prime Minister 
Kakuei Tanaka that the CCP had to thank Japan, since without the=
 Sino-Japanese 
War the CCP would not have gained power in China. 
The CCP claimed to have led the Chinese people to sustain for=
 eight years and 
ultimately win the Sino-Japanese War. The claim could not be=
 farther from the 
truth. 
More than half a century later, with the 911 terrorist attacks on=
 US soil, an 
anti-terrorist effort has become a global focus. The CCP again=
 uses deceptive 
strategies similar to what was deployed during the Sino-Japanese=
 War. Using 
anti-terrorism as a disguise, the CCP has suppressed many=
 religious believers, 
people with different opinions, local organizations, and ethnic=
 minority groups, 
labeling them terrorists. In the international anti-terrorist=
 climate, the CCP 
has launched violent persecutions. 
On September 27, 2004, the Xinhua News Agency quoted the Xinjing=
 Newspaper that 
Beijing may establish the first anti-terrorist bureau among all=
 the provinces 
and cities in China. Many overseas pro-CCP media highlighted=
 China=92s 610 Office, 
a network of government agencies set up especially to persecute=
 Falun Gong 
practitioners, as an anti-terrorist organization, and claimed=
 that the 
anti-terrorist bureau would focus on attacking terrorist=
 organizations including 
Falun Gong. 
The CCP slaps the label =93terrorists=94 on Falun Gong practitioners=
 who hold no 
weapons in their hands, do not fight back when beaten or=
 insulted, and who 
peacefully appeal against the wrongdoings of the CCP government.=
 For this 
defenseless group of kind people, the CCP has mobilized its=
 well-equipped 
=93special anti-terrorist force=94 to conduct swift persecution.=
 Furthermore, the 
CCP has used the name of anti-terrorism to evade international=
 attention and 
condemnation. The kinds of deception used here are no different=
 from the ones 
used by the CCP during the Sino-Japanese War. The CCP=92s misuse of=
 anti-terrorism 
has given this important international operation a bad name. 
Overtly Agree but Covertly Oppose, Sincerely Pretending 
The CCP does not believe its doctrines but forces others to=
 believe in them. 
This is one of the most insidious methods used by the evil cult=
 of the CCP. The 
CCP knows that its doctrines are false, and that the bankrupt=
 idea of socialism 
is untrue. The CCP doesn=92t believe in these doctrines, but forces=
 people to 
believe in them; if you do not believe in them, you are=
 persecuted. Most 
absurdly and shamefully the CCP has written such deceitful=
 ideology into the 
Constitution as the foundation of the state. 
In real life, there is an interesting phenomenon. Many high-level=
 officials lose 
their positions in power struggles in China=92s political arena=
 because of 
corruption. But these are the very people who promote honesty and=
 selflessness 
in public meetings, while engaging in bribery, corruption, and=
 other decadent 
activities behind the scenes. Many so-called =93people=92s servants=94=
 have fallen 
this way, including the former governor of Yunnan province Li=
 Jiating, the Party 
secretary of Guizhou province Liu Fangren, the Party secretary of=
 Hebei province 
Cheng Weigao, Minister of Land and Resources Tian Fengshan, and=
 the lieutenant 
governor of Anhui province Wang Huaizhong. But if you examine=
 their speeches, 
you will find that without exception, they have supported=
 anti-corruption 
campaigns and repeatedly urged their subordinates to conduct=
 themselves 
honestly, even as they themselves were embezzling funds and=
 taking bribes. 
The CCP has promoted many examples and often attracted some=
 idealistic and 
ambitious people to join the Party for decorating the Party. On=
 the surface, the 
CCP has made itself attractive. But the world can see to what a=
 pitiful degree 
China=92s moral standard is declining. Why hasn=92t the CCP=92s=
 propaganda of 
=93spiritual civilization=94 worked to correct this? 
As a matter of fact, the Communist Party leaders transmitted mere=
 lies when they 
promulgated =93Communist moral quality=94 or =93Serve the people.=94 The=
 inconsistency 
between Communist leaders=92 actions and words can be traced all=
 the way back to 
their founding father Karl Marx. Marx bore an illegitimate son;=
 Lenin contracted 
syphilis from prostitutes; Stalin was sued for forcing a sexual=
 relationship 
with a singer; Mao Zedong indulged himself in lust; Jiang Zemin=
 is promiscuous; 
the Romanian Communist leader Ceausescu=92s entire family became=
 filthy rich 
because of him; the Cuban Communist leader Castro hoards hundreds=
 of millions of 
dollars in overseas banks; and North Korea=92s demonic killer Kim=
 Il Song and his 
children lead a decadent and wasteful life. 
In daily life, ordinary people in China loathe the empty=
 political study 
sessions. Increasingly, they equivocate in political matters,=
 since everyone 
knows them to be deceptive games. But no one, neither the=
 speakers nor the 
listeners at these political meetings, would speak openly about=
 such 
deception=97it is an open secret. People call this phenomenon=
 =93sincere 
pretension.=94 The CCP=92s high tunes, either the =93Three Represents=94=
 several years 
ago, or =93improving governing capacity=94 later, or today=92s =93three 
hearts=94=97=93warming, stabilizing and gaining people=92s hearts=94=97have=
 all been 
nonsense. Which ruling party would not represent the people=92s=
 benefits? Which 
ruling party would not care about governing capacity? Which=
 ruling party is not 
about gaining people=92s hearts? Any parties that do not concern=
 themselves with 
these issues would soon be removed from the political stage. But=
 the CCP would 
treat such superfluous slogans as intricate, deep theories and=
 stir up the whole 
country to study them. 
When pretending has been gradually molded into a billion people=92s=
 habits and the 
Party=92s culture, the society becomes filled with falsity,=
 grandiosity, and 
inanity. Lacking honesty and trust, the society is in a state of=
 crisis. Why has 
the CCP acted as such? In the past, it was for its ideologies,=
 and now it is for 
its benefits. The CCP members know themselves to be pretending,=
 but they pretend 
anyway. If the CCP did not promote such slogans and formalities,=
 it wouldn=92t 
have an opportunity to act like a scoundrel or a bully. If that=92s=
 the case, how 
could it make itself followed and feared by the people? 
Abandon Conscience and Sacrifice Justice for the Party=92s=
 Interests 
In the book =93On the Communist Party=92s Moral Development,=94 Liu=
 Shaoqi [9] 
expounded especially on the need =93for Party members to subsume=
 their individual 
interests to the Party=92s interest.=94 Among CCP members, there has=
 never been a 
lack of righteous people who are concerned about the country and=
 its people, nor 
has there been a shortage of honest officials who have truly=
 served the people. 
But in the CCP=92s machinery of self-interest, these officials=
 cannot survive. 
Under constant pressure to =93submit oneself to the Party,=94 they=
 often find it 
impossible to continue, or risk being removed from positions, or=
 worse, become 
forced to join the ranks of the corrupted. 
Chinese people have personally experienced and deeply understood=
 the CCP=92s 
brutal regime and have developed a profound fear of the CCP=92s=
 violence. 
Therefore, people dare not uphold justice and no longer believe=
 in the heavenly 
laws. First they submit themselves to the CCP=92s power. Gradually=
 they become 
unfeeling and unconcerned about matters not affecting themselves.=
 Even the logic 
of their thinking has been consciously molded to succumb to the=
 CCP=92s might. 
This is the CCP=92s nature at work, to behave like a gangster and a=
 scoundrel. 
Patriotism as a Nationwide Urgent Mobilization 
The CCP=92s slogans of =93patriotism=94 and =93nationalism=94 are the=
 sugar-coating to 
seduce people. They are not only the CCP=92s main banners, but also=
 its frequently 
issued orders and time-tested strategies. Overseas Chinese, who,=
 for decades 
dare not return to China to live, may read the nationalistic=
 propaganda in the 
overseas edition of People=92s Daily and are inspired to become=
 more patriotic 
than the Chinese living inside China. Chinese people, who dare=
 not say =93no=94 to 
any CCP policy, were brave enough, under the CCP=92s leadership, to=
 storm the US 
Embassy and Consulate in China, throwing eggs and rocks and=
 burning cars and US 
flags, all under the banner of =93patriotism.=94 
The Communist Party has decided that whenever it encounters an=
 important issue 
that demands obedience from the people, it will use =93patriotism=94=
 and 
=93nationalism=94 to mobilize people on short notice. For matters=
 related to Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, Falun Gong, the collision between a US spy plane and a=
 Chinese 
fighter jet=97in all cases the CCP has used the combined method of=
 high-pressure 
terror and collective brainwashing, thus bringing people to a=
 war-like state of 
mind. This method is similar to that used by the German Fascists.=
 
By blocking all other information, the CCP=92s brainwashing has=
 been incredibly 
successful. The Chinese people, even though they do not like the=
 CCP, think in 
the twisted mode instilled by the CCP. During the US-led Iraq=
 war, for example, 
many people are stirred up watching the daily analysis on CCTV=
 [10]; they feel a 
strong sense of hatred, vengeance, and desire to fight, while at=
 the same time 
cursing another war. 
Shameless=97Mixing the Concepts of the Party and the Country,=
 Forcing People to 
Consider the Enemy as Their Father 
One of the phrases the CCP often uses to threaten people is, =93the=
 extinction of 
the Party and the country,=94 placing the =93Party=94 before the=
 =93country.=94 The 
founding principle of China is that =93there would be no new China=
 without the 
CCP.=94 From childhood, people were educated to =93listen to the=
 Party=94 and =93behave 
like good children of the Party.=94 They sang praises to the Party:=
 =93I consider 
the Party as my mother,=94 =93Oh, Party, my dear mother,=94 =93The saving=
 grace of the 
Party is deeper than the ocean,=94 =93Love for my father and mother=
 can not surpass 
love for the Party.=94[11] They would =93go and fight wherever the=
 Party directs 
us.=94 When the government offered disaster relief, people would=
 =93thank the Party 
and the government=94=97first the =93Party=94 and then the =93government.=94=
 A military 
slogan reads =93the Party commands the gun.=94 Even when the Chinese=
 experts tried 
to design the uniform for court judges, they put four golden=
 buttons on the 
neckband of the uniform. Those buttons are lined up from top to=
 bottom to 
symbolize the Party, the people, the law and the country. It=
 indicates that even 
if you are the judge, the Party will forever be positioned above=
 the =93law,=94 
=93country,=94 and =93people.=94 
The =93Party=94 has become a supreme name in China, and the =93country=94=
 has become the 
Party=92s subordinate. The =93country=94 exists for the =93Party,=94 and=
 the =93Party=94 is 
said to be the embodiment of the people and the symbol of the=
 =93country.=94 Love 
for the Party, Party leaders, and the country have been mixed=
 together, which is 
the fundamental reason why patriotism in China has become=
 twisted. 
Under the subtle but persistent influence of the CCP=92s education=
 and propaganda, 
many people, Party members or not, began to confuse the Party=
 with the country, 
whether they are aware of it or not. They have come to accept=
 that =93the Party=92s 
interest=94 is superior to all, and to concur that =93the Party=92s=
 interests equal 
the interests of the people and the country.=94 This result of the=
 CCP=92s 
indoctrination has created a wide-open space for the Chinese=
 Communist scoundrel 
group to betray the national interests. 
Play the =93Redress=94 Game and Turn Criminal Acts into =93Great=
 Accomplishments=94 
The CCP has made many blunders in history. But, it has always put=
 the blame on 
certain individuals or groups through =93redress and=
 rehabilitation.=94 This has not 
only made the victims deeply grateful for the CCP, but also=
 allowed the CCP to 
completely deny any criminal deeds. The CCP claims itself to be=
 =93not only 
unafraid of making mistakes, but also good at correcting them,=94=
 [12] and this 
has become the CCP=92s magical potion with which repeatedly to=
 escape elimination. 
Thus, the CCP remains forever =93great, glorious, and correct.=94 
Perhaps one day, the CCP will decide to redress the Tiananmen=
 Square Massacre 
and restore the reputation of Falun Gong. But these are simply=
 the roguish 
tactics that the CCP uses in a desperate attempt to prolong its=
 dying life. The 
CCP will never have the courage to reflect on itself, to expose=
 its own crimes 
and to pay for its own sins. 
******************
VI. Thorough Exposure of Scoundrel Behaviors: Attempting to=
 Eliminate 
=93Truthfulness, Compassion, Tolerance=94 through State Terror 
The fraudulent =93Tiananmen self-immolation=94 staged by the CCP evil=
 cult may be 
rated as the CCP=92s lie of the century. In order to suppress Falun=
 Gong, a 
government can be so perverse as to have seduced five people to=
 pretend to be 
Falun Gong practitioners and choreographed their fake=
 self-immolation in 
Tiananmen Square. Unbeknownst to them, these five people signed=
 their own death 
warrant, either beaten to death on the scene or killed=
 afterwards. The slow 
motion of the self-immolation video recorded by CCTV unmistakably=
 shows that Liu 
Chunling, one of the self-immolators, died after being hit on the=
 spot by a 
police officer. Other flaws in the footage included the sitting=
 posture of Wang 
Jingdong, the intact plastic bottle between his knees after the=
 fire was put 
out, the conversation between a doctor and the youngest victim=
 Liu Siying, and 
the way cameramen arrived to videotape the scene. The evidence is=
 sufficient to 
prove that the self-immolation incident was a deception=
 maliciously designed by 
the Jiang Zemin scoundrel regime in order to frame Falun Gong.=
 [13] 
A political party would use such evil and cruel methods, using=
 the nation=92s 
financial resources accumulated in the past 20 years of economic=
 reform, 
mobilizing the Party, the government, the military, the police,=
 spies, foreign 
diplomats and various other government and non-government=
 organizations, 
manipulating the system of global media coverage, implementing a=
 strict 
information blockade with individual and high-tech monitoring,=
 all to persecute 
a peaceful group of Falun Gong practitioners. 
No scoundrel in history has lied so insidiously, so completely=
 and as 
pervasively as Jiang Zemin and the CCP. They use various lies,=
 each targeting 
and manipulating different notions and ideas that people hold.=
 This way, people 
can more easily believe the CCP=92s lies, and the Party can incite=
 hatred toward 
Falun Gong. Do you believe in science? The CCP says that Falun=
 Gong is 
superstitious. Do you find politics distasteful? The CCP says=
 that Falun Gong 
engages in politics. Do you envy the rich? The CCP says that=
 Falun Gong gathers 
wealth. Do you object to organizations? The CCP says that Falun=
 Gong has a tight 
organization. Are you tired of the cult of personality that=
 lasted in China for 
several decades? The CCP says that Falun Gong exercises mental=
 control. Are you 
patriotic? The CCP says Falun Gong is anti-China. Are you afraid=
 of chaos? The 
CCP says Falun Gong disrupts stability. Do you believe that Falun=
 Gong upholds 
Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance? The CCP says Falun Gong=
 is not 
truthful, compassionate, or tolerant, and that compassion can=
 generate the 
desire to kill. 
Do you trust that the government would not make up such lies? The=
 CCP makes up 
lies that are bigger and more shocking, from suicides to=
 self-immolation, from 
killing relatives to murdering others, from killing one to=
 slaughtering many=97so 
many lies that you find it hard not to believe them. Do you=
 sympathize with 
Falun Gong? The CCP connects your political evaluation with the=
 persecution of 
Falun Gong, and demotes you, fires you, or takes away your bonus=
 if Falun Gong 
practitioners from your responsible area appeal in Beijing. You=
 are forced to 
become an enemy of Falun Gong. The CCP has kidnapped countless=
 Falun Gong 
practitioners and taken them to brainwashing sessions in an=
 effort to force them 
to give up their righteous belief and promise to stop their=
 practice. The CCP 
has used various evil reasons to persuade them, using their=
 relatives, career, 
and education to pressure them, inflicting them with various=
 cruel tortures and 
even punishing their family members and colleagues. Falun Gong=
 practitioners who 
are successfully brainwashed are used to brainwash others. The=
 vicious CCP 
insists on turning humans into demons and forcing them to walk on=
 a dark path to 
the end. 
******************
VII. Scoundrel Socialism with =93Chinese Characteristics=94 
The term =93Chinese characteristics=94 is used to cover up the CCP=92s=
 shame. The CCP 
claims all along that it owes its success in China=92s revolution=
 to =93the 
integration of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete reality of=
 Chinese 
revolution.=94 The CCP has frequently used and misused the term=
 =93characteristic=94 
as an ideological support for its capricious and roguish=
 policies. 
Capriciousness and Deceptive Means 
Under the roguish fa=E7ade of the =93Chinese characteristics,=94 the=
 only things the 
CCP has accomplished are nonsense and absurdity. 
The goal of the CCP=92s revolution was to realize public ownership=
 of the means of 
production, and it has deceived many young people into joining=
 the Party 
organization for the ideals of communism and unity; many of them=
 betrayed their 
property-owning families. But 83 years after the beginning of the=
 CCP, 
capitalism has returned, only now becoming a part of the CCP=
 itself. Today, 
among CCP leaders=92 children and relatives, many are new=
 capitalists with 
fortunes; many Party members have endeavored to join this group=
 of nouveau 
riche. The CCP eliminated the landlords and capitalists in the=
 name of 
revolution and stole their property. Now, the CCP=92s new =93royalty=94=
 has become 
even richer capitalists through embezzlement and corruption.=
 Those who followed 
the Party in the early revolutions now sigh, =93If I knew the=
 situation today, I 
would not have followed it then.=94 After several decades of sweat=
 and struggle, 
they find themselves to have simply devoted their brothers=92 and=
 fathers=92 
properties as well as their own lives to the CCP evil cult. 
The CCP speaks of the economic base determining the=
 superstructure [14]; in 
reality, it is the CCP=92s corrupt officials=92 bureaucratic economic=
 base that 
decides the superstructure relying on high pressures to maintain.=
 Suppressing 
the people has therefore become the CCP=92s basic policy. 
Another scoundrel characteristic of the CCP is manifest in=
 changing the 
definition of any cultural concepts, and then using its own=
 mutated definitions 
to criticize and control people. The concept of =93party=94 is one=
 such example. 
Since the beginning of time and all over the world, parties have=
 been 
established. Only the Communist Party exercises power beyond the=
 domain of a 
party collective. If you join the Party, it will control all=
 aspects of your 
life, including your conscience, subsistence, and private life.=
 When given 
political authority, the CCP controls the society, government,=
 and the state 
apparatus. It dictates all matters, from ones as important as who=
 should be the 
Chairman of the country or the Minister of Defense, or what=
 regulations and 
rules will be made, to as small as where one should live, with=
 whom one can 
marry, and how many children one can bear. The CCP has mustered=
 all imaginable 
methods of control. 
The CCP uses the name of dialectics to completely destroy the=
 holistic thinking, 
reasoning faculty, and inquiring spirit of philosophy. While the=
 CCP speaks 
about =93distribution according to contribution,=94 the process of=
 =93allowing some 
people to get rich first=94 has been accomplished along with=
 =93distribution 
according to power.=94 The CCP uses the disguise of =93serving the=
 people 
whole-heartedly=94 to deceive those who hold these ideals, then=
 completely 
brainwashes and controls them, gradually changing them into=
 docile tools who 
=93serve the Party whole-heartedly=94 and who dare not speak up for=
 the people. 
Party of Scoundrels with =93Chinese Characteristics=94 
Using a principle that values the Party=92s interests beyond all=
 other 
considerations, the CCP has distorted the Chinese society with=
 the means of an 
evil cult, creating a true deviated being in the human society.=
 This being is 
different from any other state, government or organization. Its=
 principle is to 
have no principle; it has no sincerity behind its smiles.=
 However, kindhearted 
people cannot understand the CCP. Based on universal moral=
 standards, they 
cannot imagine that such a roguish entity would be representing a=
 country. Using 
the excuse of the =93Chinese characteristic,=94 the CCP established=
 itself among the 
nations of the world. The =93Chinese characteristics=94 have become=
 an abbreviation 
of =93CCP=92s scoundrel characteristics.=94 
With the =93Chinese characteristics,=94 China=92s crippled capitalism=
 was transformed 
into =93socialism=94; =93unemployment=94 became =93waiting for employment=94;=
 =93being laid 
off=94 from work became =93off duty=94; =93poverty=94 became the =93initial=
 stage of 
socialism=94; and human rights and freedom of speech and belief are=
 watered down 
to the right to survive. 
Scoundrelism Imposed on the Country: An Unprecedented Moral=
 Crisis Faced by the 
Chinese Nation 
In the beginning of the 1990s, there was a popular saying in=
 China, =93I=92m a 
scoundrel and I am afraid of no one.=94 This is the malicious=
 consequence of 
several decades of the CCP=92s roguish rule =97 imposing scoundrelism=
 on the nation. 
Accompanying the fake prosperity of China=92s economy is the=
 rapidly declining 
morality in all aspects of society. 
The people=92s representatives of China oftentimes talk about the=
 issue of 
=93honesty and trust=94 during the Chinese People=92s Congress. In=
 college entrance 
exams, students are required to write about honesty and trust.=
 This is a 
reflection of a huge, looming crisis induced by the lack of trust=
 and honesty 
and the decline in morality. This crisis, although invisible, is=
 ubiquitous. 
Corruption, embezzlement, fake products, deception, and=
 individual and 
society-wide moral decline are commonplace. There is no longer=
 any basic trust 
between people. 
For those who claim to be satisfied with an improved standard of=
 living, isn=92t 
stability in their lives their primary concern? What is the most=
 important 
factor in social stability? It is morality. A society with=
 degraded morality 
cannot possibly provide security and assurance. 
The CCP has cracked down on almost all traditional religions by=
 now and has 
dismantled the traditional value system. The unscrupulous way by=
 which the CCP 
seizes wealth and deceives people has had a trickle down effect=
 on the entire 
society, turning the society into one of scoundrels. The CCP,=
 which rules by 
means of scoundrels, also essentially needs a scoundrel society=
 as an 
environment to survive. That is why the CCP tries everything it=
 can to drag the 
people down to its level, attempting to turn the Chinese people=
 into scoundrels 
to various extents. This is how the CCP=92s scoundrel nature is=
 eradicating the 
moral foundation that had long sustained the Chinese people. 
******************
Conclusion 
=93It is easier to alter rivers and mountains than to change one's=
 nature.=94 [15] 
History has proven that every time the CCP loosens its bondage=
 and chains, it 
does so without intending to abandon them. After the Great Famine=
 of the early 
1960s, the CCP adapted economic reform policies [16] aiming to=
 restore 
agricultural production, but without the intent to change the=
 =93slave=94 status of 
Chinese peasants. The economic reform and liberalization in the=
 1980s had no 
constraint on the CCP=92s raising of a butcher=92s knife on its own=
 people in 1989. 
In the future, the CCP will continue to alter its fa=E7ade but will=
 not change its 
scoundrel nature. 
Some people may think that the past belongs to the past and the=
 situation has 
changed, and that the CCP now is not the CCP then. Some may be=
 satisfied with 
the false appearance they see and even mistakenly believe that=
 the CCP has 
improved, is in the process of reforming, or intends to make=
 amends; thus, they 
constantly brush away past memories. All these can only give the=
 CCP scoundrel 
group the opportunity to continue to survive and threaten=
 humankind. 
All efforts by the CCP are to make people forget the past. All of=
 the people=92s 
struggles are to remember what has happened. 
In fact, the history of the CCP is a history that has severed=
 people=92s memories, 
a history in which children don=92t know the true experiences of=
 their parents, a 
history in which hundreds of millions of ordinary citizens live=
 in and suffer 
from the enormous conflict between cursing the CCP=92s past and=
 holding out hope 
for the CCP=92s present. 
When the evil specter of communism fell upon the human world, the=
 Communist 
Party unleashed the scum of society and utilized the rebellion of=
 hoodlums to 
seize and establish political power. What it has done, by means=
 of bloodstained 
rule and tyranny, is establish and maintain despotism in the form=
 of a =93Party 
Possession.=94 By using the so-called ideology of =93struggle=94 that=
 opposes nature, 
heaven=92s laws, human nature, and the universe, it destroys human=
 conscience and 
benevolence, and further destroys traditional civilization and=
 morality. It has 
used bloody slaughters and forced brainwashing to establish an=
 evil communist 
cult, creating a nation of insanity in order to rule the country.=
 Throughout the 
history of the CCP, there have been violent periods when the red=
 terror reached 
its peak, and awkward periods when the CCP narrowly escaped being=
 destroyed. 
Each time, the CCP used its scoundrel behavior to extricate=
 itself from crises, 
but only to head for the next round of violence, continuing to=
 deceive the 
Chinese people. 
When people recognize the CCP=92s scoundrel nature and resist being=
 deceived by 
its false images, the end will arrive for the CCP and its=
 scoundrel nature. 
********
In comparison with China=92s 5,000-year history, the 55 years of=
 the CCP=92s rule go 
by in a blink of an eye. Before the CCP came into existence,=
 China had created 
the most magnificent civilization in the history of humankind.=
 The CCP seized 
the opportunity of China=92s domestic troubles and foreign invasion=
 to wreak havoc 
on the Chinese nation. It has taken away tens of millions of=
 lives, destroyed 
countless families, and sacrificed the ecological resources upon=
 which China=92s 
survival depends. What is even more devastating is the near=
 destruction of 
China=92s moral basis and prominent cultural tradition. 
What will be the future of China? What direction will China take?=
 Such serious 
questions are too complicated to discuss in a few words. However,=
 one thing is 
for certain: if there is no reconstruction of the nation=92s=
 morality, no 
restoration of the relationships between humans and nature, and=
 between humans, 
heaven and earth, if there is no faith or culture for a peaceful=
 coexistence 
among humans, it will be impossible for the Chinese nation to=
 have a bright 
future. 
With several decades of brainwashing and suppression, the CCP has=
 instilled its 
way of thinking and its standard for good and bad into the depths=
 of the Chinese 
people=92s lives. This has led them to accept and identify with the=
 CCP=92s 
fabrication to a certain degree, and become part of its=
 falsehood, thereby 
providing the ideological basis for its existence. 
To eliminate from our lives the wicked doctrines instilled by the=
 CCP, to see 
clearly the CCP=92s completely evil nature, and to restore our=
 human nature and 
conscience=97this is the first essential and necessary step on the=
 path toward a 
smooth transition into a CCP-free society. 
Whether this path can be walked steadily and peacefully will=
 depend on changes 
made in every Chinese person=92s heart. Even though the CCP appears=
 to possess all 
the resources and violent apparatuses in the country, if every=
 Chinese person 
believes in the power of the truth and safeguards our morality,=
 the evil specter 
of the CCP will lose the foundation for its existence. All=
 resources may return 
to the hands of the righteous instantly, and that is when the=
 rebirth of China 
will take place. 
Only without the Chinese Communist Party, would there be a new=
 China. 
Only without the Chinese Communist Party, would China have hope.=
 
Without the Chinese Communist Party, the righteous and kind=
 Chinese people will 
rebuild China=92s historical magnificence. 
Notes: 
[1] According to traditional Confucian thought, emperors or kings=
 rule according 
to the mandate from heaven, and to be given such an authority,=
 their moral 
achievements have to match that supreme responsibility. From the=
 Mencius, a 
similar thought can also be found. In the verse =93Who Grants the=
 Monarchical 
Power?=94 Mencius said, =93It was from heaven.=94 when asked who=
 granted the land and 
the governing authority to Emperor Shun. The idea of the divine=
 origin of power 
can also be found in western Christian tradition. In Romans 13:1=
 of the Bible
