Subject: BUG: should not be allowed to delete an SBML/GCM file used by a view
Date: Tue, 5 Aug 2008 10:11:56 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.926)

When a SBML or GCM files is used by an analysis or learn view, it  
should not be allowed to delete it.  Renaming also needs to be  
restricted or the view needs to be updated to be linked to the new  
name.  A message should pop up telling the user why the deletion is  
being disallowed.
