Only the "=" and "!=" relational operators are supported. And ">" and "<" are
supported on single-bit slicing of a std_logic_vector. These supported
relational operators are compiled to bit extractions on the LPN. It would be
more convenient to support the conversion on data directly. A separate feature
request is submitted on this. Move this one to closed.
