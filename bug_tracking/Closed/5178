Subject: FEATURE: add support for non-disabling semantics to LPNs

We need to add a way to specify when an enabling condition is  
disabling or non-disabling.  When non-disabling is converted to SBML,  
the trigger should be marked as persistent.  However, there is one  
complication which is that it is non-disabling in terms of the  
enabling condition but it is still disabling in terms of the marking.
