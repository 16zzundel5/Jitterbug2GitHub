 here as a Phoenician, I had never set aside an evening to devote to getting a pizza here.  So for my last evening here, I made a point of going. It was okay. I don't think it's the best pizza in Arizona, let alone America.  It definitely wasn't worth the 2 1/2 hour wait. And it absolutely was not worth the attitude from the bitchy hostess. I didn't like the charred bread that covered my hands and face with soot and gave the pizza a bitter and burnt flavor. And the pizza with salami we ordered was limp and soggy.

It should be taught as an example in Economics 101. How could seating for 30 at a time translate into a nationally famous restaurant? Before I get to the nitty, let me make my disclaimer so all you potential flamers can chill and just move on your merry way. I don't wait. I want a reservation. I prefer an invitation by my host with RSVP. Bianco's is yet another example of our
