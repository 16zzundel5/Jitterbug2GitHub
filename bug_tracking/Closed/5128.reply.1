1) Create a set V, V'' that include the user-defined interesting variables.

2) Add to V and V'' the variables that appear in enabling conditions in any
process that includes a failure transition.

3) Add to V' the variables that appear in assignment expressions that assign to
any variable in V''.

4) Add to V' the variables that appear in enabling conditions for any process
that includes assignments to a variable in V''.

5) V'' = V' - V

6) V = V'

7) If V'' is not empty, go to step 3.

Note that if a continuous variable is added to V, its rate variable is also
added to V at the same time.

V  = all the variables found to be interesting up to the previous iteration.
V' = all the variables found to be interesting including the current iteration.
V''= the variables found to be interesting during the previous iteration.
