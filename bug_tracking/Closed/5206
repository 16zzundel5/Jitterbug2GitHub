Subject: BUG complex formation field grayed out initially

When plopping down species in the schematic editor, it initially grays out the
field for the complex formation eq constant when said field should always be
available.  Reopening the species or changing its type ungrays the field, so
it's not completely broken, but it should still be fixed.
