Subject: Re: CHANGE: make GCM parameters global SBML paramteers (PR#5502)
Date: Mon Sep 26 15:11:50 2011

When a GCM is opened, check if these parameters exist in the SBML file, and if
not, add with default values (or if they exist in the GCM, use those custom
values).

These should now be used during model generation rather than the GCM
parameters.
