Since a model may now include random initial conditions, ODE simulations
may not always return the same thing.  Therefore, ODE simulation should
allow for the selection of the number of runs.  This also means that
overwrite and append should be selectable for ODE simulation.  When
overwrite is selected, all run files in the appropriate directory should
be removed.
