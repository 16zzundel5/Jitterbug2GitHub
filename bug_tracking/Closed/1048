Hi,
This is good news for all digital camera owners. A Photoshop video training
course with over 8 hours of tutorials. I've tried it out and it worked for
me, so why shouldn't it help you to get an insight into the workings of
digital image editing? You will find more detailed information on the course
on this site:

Regards,
Ralph
