I want to do assigns with 0 to inf.  Hao says assign(sig, '1') should do it,
but
This line causes a compiler syntax error.

The workaround hack is to type assign(sig, '1', 0, inf);
However - this won't compile and simulate in a VHDL simulator.

There are three types of assigns that need support...
assign(sig, '1');               -- possibly 0 to inf interpretation
assign(sig, '1', 20);          -- constant delay number
assign(sig, '1', 24, 50);       -- the usual lower upper.

Of course my favorite (from the renegade handshake package) is
assign(sig, '1', 24, 50, 1 ps);    -- but maybe I'm the only one who likes it.
