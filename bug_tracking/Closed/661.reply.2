The issue here has to do with time-dependent choice.  Postprocessing can
introduce differing behaviors when time-dependent choice is used.  Posets (-ts)
is always time-dependent.  Bap allows either semantic option (-tp is
time-independent, -tt is time-dependent).  Therefore, switching between -tp and
-tt with postprocessing yields both possible circuits.  Since -tp is now the
default, domino2 can be safely added back into the regression test suite.
