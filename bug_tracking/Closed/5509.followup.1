Does it cause a problem to change it?  I think the that you are right that check box and radio button are the same when there is just one option.  However, check box I think is more conventional here.  By the way, the incoming as you are noticing is filling up with minor cosmetic things as I go through the documentation.  I will let you know if any of them are urgent.  In many cases, I'm not wanted them changed yet as they will change my screen captures that I already have.

Cheers,

Chris
