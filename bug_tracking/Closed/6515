O tasks are not CPU bound and thus do not require a thread. The main point of async is to not block threads during IO bound tasks. ??? juharr May 24 at 16:55

@jdweng: Nope, not at all. Even if it created new threads, that's very different from creating a new process. ??? Jon Skeet May 24 at 16:57

@RubberDuck: Yes, it may use a thread from the thread pool for the continuation. But it's not starting a thread in the way that the OP imagines here - it's not like it says "Take this ordinary method, now run it in a separate thread - there, that's async." It's much subtler than that. ??? Jon Skeet May 25 at 5:18
