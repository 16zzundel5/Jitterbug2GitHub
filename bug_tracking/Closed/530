Dear Chris

Later than I expected, I have received two reviews of your proposal. Thanks for
your patience. I shall copy the relevant sections here and then continue
afterwards.

******************
Reviewer 1

I think that this book does fill a hole that exists.  Dr. Myers does a
reasonable job of presenting sufficient breadth and detail.  I do strongly
suggest that a section on synchronizers be included.  With this information, and
some improvement to the text as it is, I believe this would be a useful book for
those both in industry and academia.

*******************
Reviewer 2

As the author notes, there is no recent textbook on asynchronous design. The
book by Brzozoski and Seger gives a comprehensive and rigorous overview of the
subject, but is not written as a textbook.

 The scope of the book seems reasonable.  It is clearly written by someone in
the synthesis camp.  The focus on explaining the Huffman and Muller schools is a
reasonable one to take.

  In the prospectus, the author lists several current applications of
asynchronous circuits, including Intel's RAPPID (a research project) and
Philips's pager.  Myrinet's "pipeline synchronization" should be added to this
list.  It would be constructive to add a chapter to survey recent asynchronous
designs, both research projects and shipping products.  The U. Manchester Amulet
belongs here.  This should definitely be a separate chapter, as this material
will become dated faster than the rest of the content of the book.  Nonetheless,
I believe that adding examples of substantial designs will lend credibility to
the book.

  Another possible addition would be a chapter could with examples of mixed
synchronous/asynchronous designs such as self-resetting domino logic, pulse
logic ALU's, source synchronous communication.  The role of synchronization in
synchronous designs along with a discussion of metastability should be here.
There are still plenty of designers who don't really grasp what metastability is
about.  This chapter could include connections of asynchronous techniques to
"far-out" technologies such as RSFQ (superconducting) logic, etc.

  Now for comments on the three chapters (5-7) I examined.  I believe that the
use of running examples will make this material accessible to a wider audience.
On the other hand, I found the complete lack of theorems and proofs to be
disturbing.  The presentation is very "operational" -- it describes step-by-step
what each algorithms does, and the procedure for synthesis, but it doesn't give
me a sense that I know that it's correct. I just understand how it works for the
particular examples.  I hope that this can be corrected with some modest
revision.
  First, each of chapters five and six should clearly define the synthesis
problems that they address.  Synthesis is a function (in the mathematical sense)
whose domain is a specification (i.e. a flow table or a signal transition graph)
and whose range is a netlist.  These functions should be clearly defined.  Then,
the author can explain that one way to implement one of these functions is to
decompose it into three or four simpler functions (e.g. state minimization,
state assignment, and logic synthesis).  Each section that presents one of these
simpler functions can take a similar approach.  In the end, the detailed
algorithms can be presented in imperative pseudo-code (i.e. operational terms),
but a more functional/mathematical description of the high level problems would
help.  Theoretical results that justify key steps in the synthesis procedures
should be (in my opinion) marked with theorems.  To keep this text accessible,
to less theoretically orient readers, most proofs can be omitted

? a citation to
the relevant literature should do the job.  [BS95] provides much of the=
 theory
that is lacking in this text, and frequent citations would help cover t=
his gap.
I think an occasional proof is a fine idea, in particular when such a p=
roof is
short and contributes to understanding the bigger picture.  Pseudo-code=

fragments should include comments.  Of course, the detailed description=
 will be
in the text, but a few comments in the code can provide useful clues to=
 the
reader and make the connection to the text clearer.

  It would be helpful if the examples could be motivated by a "story pr=
oblem"
style example.  This is done nicely with the wine shop example in chapt=
er 7. The
examples in chapters 5 and 6 are more of the "consider this flow table"=
 or (STG)
style.  For readers not familiar with asynchronous design, the obvious =
question
is:
  "Why should I care about some made-up flow table? I want to know if I=
 can do
anything real with this stuff."
Motivating the examples with some, semi-plausible description of what t=
hey could
be used for helps enhance the readers intuition.  As I noted at the beg=
inning of
this paragraph, chapter 7 handles this well.

I liked chapter 7.  A comprehensive description of the authors POSET te=
chniques
is a good contribution.  This chapter should include descriptions of ot=
her
techniques such as timed automata (e.g. Kronos), Abadi and Lamports
"old-fashioned recipe", Pena's work on relative timing, etc.  A compari=
son of
the various approaches would be a very useful contribution.

  In summary, I think that the subject matter is an important one, and =
the
author is right to note the lack of an up-to-date textbook for asynchro=
nous
design.  I've suggested several ideas (mainly additions) that I believe=
 would
strengthen the book.  Of course, incorporating all of these suggestions=
 would
lead to a bloated text.  The ideal approach would be to encourage the a=
uthor to
persuade one of his colleagues at another institution to use a "beta" d=
raft of
the text in courses taught by someone other than the author. I expect t=
hat such
feedback would focus on the most important changes and would establish =
the value
of the text to a wider audience.


***********************************

Overall, these are positive reports which support my view that this is =
a timely
book with good potential. I hope you find them encouraging. I shall be
recommending to our editorial committee that you be offered a contract =
for the
book. In making that recommendation, it would be useful to hear your re=
action to
the referees' reviews. Reviewer 1 makes one substantial suggestion, whi=
le
reviewer 2 has several recommendations. I agree with a few of these (in=
cluding
more applications, for instance) but we should be careful to avoid lett=
ing the
book become too large, since that can make it very difficult to price s=
ensibly.

I look forward to hearing from you and again, thanks for your patience.=


Best wishes

Phil
