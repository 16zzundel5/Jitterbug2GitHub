Subject: Re: stari_old3.er is a TEL not an ER (PR#537)
Date: Tue Jan  9 13:27:02 2001

Fixed as follows:

260 xia:~/atacs/examples> CVSmv er/stari_old3.er tel/stari_old3.tel
cvs remove: scheduling `er/stari_old3.er' for removal
cvs remove: use 'cvs commit' to remove this file permanently
cvs add: scheduling file `tel/stari_old3.tel' for addition
cvs add: use 'cvs commit' to add this file permanently
261 xia:~/atacs/examples> cd ..
262 xia:~/atacs> cvs commit
...

FYI, CVSmv is a script I wrote:

265 xia:~/atacs> cat ~peskin/customs/bin/CVSmv
#!/bin/csh -f
mv         ${1} ${2}
cvs remove ${1}
cvs add         ${2} 
266 xia:~/atacs> 

I will now move this report to Needs testing.  Once you are satisfied that it
is indeed fixed, please move it to Closed.
