>=20
> STABLE RELEASE
>=20
> * New features
>=20
>  - The ASTNode class has a new function double getValue() that
>    returns the numerical value of the ASTNode as a double.  This
>    includes returning values for constants such as AST_CONSTANT_PI,
>    AST_CONSTANT_E, and AST_NAME_AVOGADRO, or '1' for an ASTNode of =
type
>    AST_CONSTANT_TRUE and '0' for AST_CONSTANT_FALSE.  Note, it does
>    not attempt to evaluate the node and thus will return NaN for a
>    function or node representing a named variable, and AST_NAME_TIME.
>=20
>  - There has been a complete review of validation messages.  These
>    have been unified in terms of spacing and line returns.  In
>    addition many have been enhanced with additional model specific
>    information designed to assist in locating and fixing the issues.
>=20
>  - There is now an interface to PHP.  This has been tested on all
>    platforms.
>=20
>  - Historically libSBML did not provide unsetFoo functions where
>    the attribute was a required attribute with a default value.
>    At user request we have changed this so every attribute has a
>    corresponding unset function.  Note that where the attribute
>    has a default value it is still considered 'set' but not
>    considered to have been explicitly set and will therefore not
>    appear in the written output.
>=20
>  - The L3Parser will now correctly parse a unary plus.
>=20
>  - The L3Parser will now parse chains of relational operators.
>    Identical operators become ASTNodes with relational type and
>    each argument as a direct child.  Thus 'x < y < z' becomes
>    an ASTNode of type AST_RELATIONAL_LT with three children
>    representing x, y and z.  Non identical operators use a logical
>    'and' function to combine the arguments. Thus 'x < y > z'
>    becomes an ASTNode of type AST_LOGICAL_AND with two children
>    each representing the relational operator; that is
>    and(lt(x,y), gt(y,z))
>=20
>  - The ability to index lists in the python bindings has been =
improved.
>=20
>  - A new value 'LIBSBML_MISSING_METAID' has been added to the
>    OperationReturnValues_t enumeration.  This value will be returned
>    when a user attempts to set an annotation on an object that has
>    no metaid attribute set.  Note this is a change in behaviour as
>    previously the value returned would have been
>    'LIBSBML_UNEXPECTED_ATTRIBUTE'.  We hope this change makes the
>    issue clearer to users.
>=20
>  - The package extension mechanism has been expanded to allow the
>    extension of individual ListOfFoo classes.
>=20
> * Bug fixes
>=20
>  - Conversion from SBML Level 3 to Level 2 was losing some
>    LocalParameters. This has been sorted.  Thanks to Matthias
>    K=C3=B6nig for spotting and reporting the problem.
>=20
>  - Fixed a bug where using the expat parser failed to correctly
>    report the presence of invalid XML namespaces.
>=20
>  - Sourceforge libSBML Tracker #393: LibSBML was failing when
>    built on an ARM processor running Fedora.  This has been
>    sorted out.  Thanks to Zbigniew J=C4=99drzejewski-Szmek for
>    reporting the issue and testing solutions.
>=20
>  - The formulaParser was incorrectly parsing particular syntax
>    involving exponential, plus/minus signs and no spacing i.e.
>    '2e3-3' was failing to parse.  This has been corrected.
>    Thanks to Kieran Smallbone for reporting this and apologies
>    for the length of time it took to fix.
>=20
>  - Sourceforge libSBML Tracker #402: The functions that deal with
>    user data on both ASTNode and SBase objects have been made
>    to work with const versions of objects where appropriate.
>    Thanks to Takeshi Abe for the request and the patch.
>=20
>  - 'comp' package-specific bug fixes:
>=20
>    - The code for determining whether an external file is available
>      has been further tightened up.
>=20
>  - 'fbc' package-specific bug fixes:
>=20
>    - A bug in the code that reads GeneAssociations as an annotation
>      meant information was being lost.  This has been corrected.
>      Thanks to Matthias K=C3=B6nig for reporting the problem.
>=20
>=20
>  - 'layout' package-specific bug fixes:
>=20
>    - The names of some functions meant they were failing to
>      correctly port to the Python bindings.  The binding mechanism
>      has been fixed to correct this.  Thanks to Kieran Smallbone
>      for reporting this.
>=20
>    - The SpeciesReferenceGlyph attribute 'role' can take the value
>      'undefined' but this was not written out. This has been
>      changed.
>=20
> * Configuration/build system changes
>=20
>  - This release includes pre-built binaries for the MATLAB
>    bindings that should work for many Linux and MacOSX
>    platforms.  Please advise us it you find a combination
>    of platform and MATLAB version for which these fail.
>=20
> * Miscellaneous
>=20
>  - The names of some arguments to functions have
>    been modified to convey the fact that the object
>    is not owned by the collection object to which it
>    has been added.
>=20
> EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE
>=20
> * New features
>=20
>  - 'distrib' package-specific updates:
>=20
>    - There are new example programs that will create the
>      examples given in the current specification.
>=20
>  - 'multi' package-specific updates:
>=20
>    - The multi code has been updated in line with the specification
>      Release 1.0.2 dated November 2014. This code has been contributed
>      by Fengkai Zhang. Many thanks, Fengkai.
>=20
>  - 'spatial' package-specific updates:
>=20
>    - The spatial code has been updated in line with the specification
>      Release 0.90 dated March 2015.
>=20
> * Bug fixes
>=20
>  - 'multi' package-specific bug fixes:
>=20
>    - The multi attributes that can be added to a math  element
>      where being lost when written out.  This has been fixed.
