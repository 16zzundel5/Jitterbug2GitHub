dot2sbml does not work with paths with spaces.  This is likely true of
other things too like xhtml viewing, etc.

I was getting the same error, but then I ran the code in the cmd window and
may have figured out what the problem is. This appears to be a linux based
program, which does not do well if there are spaces in the path name ("My
Documents", "Documents and Settings"). 

I moved the file to C:\Pearl and it ran without any problems. I've included
the original error message below.

It seems that others are having this problem also.  Have you installed
ActivePerl?  If so, please check if you have this file:

C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe

CLASS: if anyone has got this to work, please let me know.  If you are
having the same problems and perl is installed and located where listed
above, then send me your ".ckt" file and I will convert it for you.
