Hi Leandro,

I think I've fixed the issue with using libsbml's flatten with grid models. 
Could you please test for me?  You can 
go into preferences and select to use libsbml for flatten then try to simulate
your grid models.  Please ignore the 
NaN error as I've fixed that one too but only for new grids.

Chris
