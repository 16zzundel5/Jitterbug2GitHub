I created a GCM consisting of a promoter P repressed by the biochemical species AB. With biochemical abstraction checked in the GCM, I created an analysis view and ran a simulation, resulting in an error message stating that reb2sac failed to create the kinetic law for R_repression_binding_P_Biochemical_A_B. When I unchecked biochemical abstraction and created a new analysis view, on the other hand, I was able to run a simulation without any errors.
