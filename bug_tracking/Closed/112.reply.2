Sungtae, do you mean to type literally "*.g" at the ATACS prompt?
I don't think atacs will expand wildcard characters like that.

Chris, even if I rename the variable "ss", I still get the seg fault if I do
what Sangtae seems to mean in [2] (See below.) 

Can either of you give me a full path name to the .g file you used?
