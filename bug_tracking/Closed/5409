I just discovered an issue with our generated species names uniqueness  
check, and I wanted to get your opinion about it.  Namely, if you open  
an SBML file that includes the species RNAP then try to edit that  
species you get a message that "Illegal Values Entered".  First of  
all, that is a cryptic message.  It was meant for errors in values,  
but we used the same function "checkValues" to make sure the  
identifier was not a special one (i.e., "RNAP", *+"_RNAP", or  
*"_bound").  We were wanting to prevent the user from creating an  
species ID that would alias with one of those that we generate.   
However, we now open SBML files that may have been hand generated.  We  
also may open SBML files generated by the GCM to SBML process which  
will include these species.  Therefore, we would not want to prevent  
someone from having these species in their model.

I'm not sure the best solution to this issue, but here are some  
options I can think of:

1) Remove the check and assume if someone does this they are okay with  
the aliasing that may result.  Downside is aliasing may not be intended.

2) Make it a warning but perhaps only when the model includes  
influences.  Trickier for the _RNAP and _bound values as the warning  
could be spurious.  Also, assume you add an influence later, do we  
give a warning then about the aliasing?  Or give the warning on save?   
Or make it a validation rule during "save and check"?

3) Ensure that GCM to SBML creates unique identifiers.  Namely, if  
there is an RNAP species, then create some other unique name to use  
during generation.  Downside is what if aliasing was indeed intended.   
For example, one could create a GCM, convert to SBML, then add more  
influences to this SBML, then generate again.  Perhaps, they want the  
RNAP to be aliased.  This could be useful when say you want some  
things modeled in an alternative way to our generator.

Thoughts?  Other options?
