Subject: Re: BUG: abstraction of species used only in a rule (PR#4574)
Date: Sat Nov 14 02:28:03 2009

A species is not irrelevant if it is used in:
1) An initial assignment expression for a relevant species.
2) An algebraic rule that includes a relevant species.
3) An assignment or rate rule expression for a relevant species.
4) A event trigger, delay, or assignment expression that involves an assignment
to a relevant species.
5) A constraint expression.

An irrelevant species still needs to be removed from:
1) An event assignment to it.  The event should be removed if no assignments
remain after removing the one to the irrelevant species.
2) An algebraic rule which is composed of irrelevant species.
