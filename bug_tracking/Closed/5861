> STABLE RELEASE
>=20
> * Flux Balance Constraints
>=20
>  - The first official version of the specification of Flux Balance
>    Constraints is now available and thus the libSBML code for
>    'fbc' is now included in the stable release of libSBML.  This
>    means that all prebuilt binaries for the stable release will
>    include the 'fbc' package code. The src archive containing
>    libSBML core code will continue to be available but there will be
>    additional src archives available in the stable branch: one
>    containing libSBML core plus all stable packages and additional
>    archives of the individual package code.
>=20
>    NOTE: The libSBML GNU make-based build system has not been updated
>          for packages. Thus, to build from src, it is necessary to
>          use the CMake build system.
>=20
> * New features
>=20
>  - The converter that expands SBML FunctionDefinition constructs has
>    been extended with an additional option that allows the user to
>    specify particular <functionDefinition> objects that should not be
>    expanded.
>=20
>  - We have changed the behavior of the converter that converts
>    between core Levels and Versions of SBML.  This converter has a
>    boolean option, 'strict', that determines whether an invalid model
>    can be converted or produced.  The code originally assumed that
>    'strict =3D false' refers to syntactic validity only, and so even
>    when the flag was set to false, the converter could fail to
>    convert a model if semantic validity was not preserved.  This
>    interpretation has been changed because people felt it was not
>    useful; now, setting 'strict' to 'false' will always convert a
>    model, and if there are errors related to altered semantics, the
>    errors will be logged in the usual error log.
>=20
>  - Documentation for the 'comp' and 'fbc' C++ API is now available.
>=20
>  - 'comp' package updates:
>=20
>    - The C API for comp is now available with an example of
>      creating a model using this API.
>=20
>    - The majority of 'comp' package validation rules have now been
>      implemented and will be reported.  Validation has also been
>      expanded to apply validation from core and other packages
>      (where appropriate) to any ModelDefinitions contained within a
>      comp model.
>=20
> * Bug fixes
>=20
>  - LibSBML was still writing out the deprecated, and in some cases
>    removed, attribute 'charge' on a <species>. This is no longer the
>    case.
>=20
>  - Some files caused the SBML Level and Version converter to enter an
>    endless loop. This has been fixed.  Thanks to the good folks at
>    Persistent Systems Ltd. for reporting this.
>=20
>  - Reading an attribute with a value of type 'double' was failing=20
>    to report when a different type was encountered for the value.
>    This has now been sorted and will be correctly logged as an=20
>    error by the readSBML functions.
>=20
>  - The Level and Version converter was in some cases running unit
>    validation even if the user had specified that they did not
>    require strict unit validation.  This was in fact done by libSBML
>    to allow an error to be logged; however, it has become clear that
>    the large computational overhead of running unit validation is
>    unecessary to merely log an error.  Thus, if the user has declared
>    that they do not require unit validity, the checks will no longer
>    be applied.
>=20
>  - 'layout' package-specific bug fixes:
>=20
>    - The extension namespaces were not being correctly set. This
>      has been fixed.
>=20
>  - 'comp' package-specific bug fixes:
>=20
>    - The function 'renameSIdRefs' now functions properly for
>      SBaseRef-derived classes.
>=20
> * Configuration/build system changes
>=20
>  - 'fbc' package-specific build system changes:
