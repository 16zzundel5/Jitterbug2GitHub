Subject: Re: BUG: rename of gcm does not remove old xml file (PR#5376)

Similarly, copy does not produce a new xml immediately.

However in both the case of copy and rename, the xml gets copied over the first
time the GCM is opened.

When you delete a gcm, the xml is also not removed as well.

Need to think about what is the best approach.

Are the GCM and XML considered as one file or two?
