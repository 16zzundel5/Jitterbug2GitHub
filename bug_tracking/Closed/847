Chris,

Sorry about the delay.  Here are the files, finally.  I cleaned them up a bit
and changed some file and component names so that they would make sense to
someone other than myself.  Feel free to remove comments, especially the ones at
the top of each file.  And just so you know, I made sure that they all verified
properly using the commands:
atacs -tsva wrapper1.vhd wrapper1_env.vhd wrapper
atacs -tsva wrapper2.vhd wrapper2_env.vhd wrapper
atacs -tsva wrapper3.vhd wrapper3_env.vhd wrapper

If there is anything else you need, feel free to ask and I'll see what I can do.

- Michael
