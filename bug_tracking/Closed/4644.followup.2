This should be the only location other than showing graphs.  By the  
way, it appears that you cannot create a learn view from a VHDL file,  
you get an exception.  I've logged a new feature request explaining  
how this can be done using atacs to generate the needed g file.

As for other file types for verification, not within LEMA but within  
ATACS.  However, in atacs, we do not need to do file conversion to  
LHPNs, so it should just work.  Famous last words :-).

I'm closing this one.
