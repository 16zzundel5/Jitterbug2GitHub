Subject: BUG: Analysis views read incorrect files due to version problem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

When I ran a simulation, I kept getting the wrong results and a wrong
model.  I later found out it was because I had an old .xml file in the
analysis view.  This file might have been created by an old BioSim
version.  Because of this file, BioSim always read and used this file
to simulate, ignoring the top level .sbml.  When I deleted the .xml
file, I could no longer access my analysis view and had to remake it.

I think this problem may fixed if you created projects in the new
versions of BioSim, however, a lot of my projects have this .xml file
in it, and I really don't want to remake all my projects.  Plus, I'm
not sure how or where this .xml file came from, but it will cause
problems if this file exists in an analysis view.
