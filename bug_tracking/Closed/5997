Ok, there is a workaround on this one.  Don't use initial assignments :-(

Apparently, this is sort of a JSBML issue.  Namely, if you try to remove an initialAssignment when one does not exist, it crashes.  However, if no initialAssignments exist, it is okay.  I've fixed this in that we now check for the presence of an initial assignment before trying to delete it.

Please test.
