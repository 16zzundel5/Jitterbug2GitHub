FOR YOUR ATTENTION: 

In our search for a trustworthy person to faithfully carry out this private and 
confidential transaction,we came upon your highly esteemed profile.

My name is Dr.Petrit Revania working with a liquidation firm appointed by the 
High Court of Justice (Chancery Division)as the Official Receiver(O.R) to wind 
up a large company here in England(NOW LIQUIDATED).The company was involved in 
child labour and have borrowed money from various creditors and persistently 
refused to pay back,hence the winding up process against it. 

In the process,it was our responsibility to sell the properties of the company 
and pay all debts owed to the creditors .It is part of the law that all 
directors and management staff of the company shall cease to hold office when 
we the liquidators take over.This gives us full control. Presently I have 
accessed the debts of the company,I came to find out that there is excess of 
funds available.Working with my partner the principal Audit Officer,we have 
agreed that the company is not worth having this money because of their inhuman 
and ungodly act to fellow humans. 

We therefore seek your kind assistance to incorporate you to our already laid 
out plan for the perfection of this business to include you as one of the 
creditors to enable us keep part of the excess funds for ourselves.we will 
ensure that the 
Chancery Division recognises you as one of the debenture holder of the company 
holding the value of Security Shares we shall attach to your name and make 
approval for payment in your favour.

You can be rest assured that all legal procedures will be followed to avoid any 
risk.Kindly respond to this message via this email(drpetrit@omegafind.net) I 
await your response

Sincerely, 
Petrit Revania
