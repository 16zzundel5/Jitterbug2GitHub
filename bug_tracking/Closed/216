In order to improve runtime of the synthesis algorithms, the quiescent variable

in the regionADT is no longer created correctly.  It does not appear to have
any bearing on the quality of synthesis results and only affects some context
signal choices.

This variable since no longer supported should be completely removed from the
code.
