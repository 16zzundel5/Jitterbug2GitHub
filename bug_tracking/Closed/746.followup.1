Sorry for the delay.  I will look at this as soon as I can, but it may be 
awhile.  I've got Tomohiro visiting and lots of work piling up while he 
does.

By the way, had a nice chat with a guy from RIT.  Sounds like your 
interview went well.  I also got a reference request from Micron.

Good luck.

Chris
