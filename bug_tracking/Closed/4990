Subject: CHANGE: expressions on transitions need to be complete states
Date: Thu, 20 May 2010 12:23:15 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

The transitions in the generated LHPN should be labeled with  
expressions over all input variables.  Should use equals for DMV  
variables.  This also means that DMV variables need to be assigned to  
a single value consistently.  In other words, move away from DMV  
thresholds and instead have DMV values.

In the future, we may want the ability represent DMV thresholds with  
uniform distributed values for more precision.
