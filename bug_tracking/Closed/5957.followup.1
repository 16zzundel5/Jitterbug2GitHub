Hi Chris,

I opened the Constants tab, clicked Add Constant, then named it "fg," set the initial value to 3, and changed the Constant field to false. I then opened the Schematic tab and tried to move "fg." The move was successful but the following exception was generated:

13/12/06 09:38:45 ERROR jsbml.Model: An element with the id "Glyph__fg" is already present in this model  test1. The new element will not be added to the model.
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot register generalGlyph.

I will be in the office this afternoon if you'd like to see it in person. I sent my job app materials to Ilias yesterday and will be chatting with him on Skype in the next couple of hours.

Cheers,

Nic

I cannot reproduce this one.  Can you try this again and if it still does not
work, come and show me exactly what
you are doing?
