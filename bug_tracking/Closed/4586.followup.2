In the advanced options, BDD Linkspace Size appears twice.  The  
confusion I think is with check boxes coming before and values filled  
in after label.  Here and other places with value boxes, perhaps put  
them on their own line.  Also this checkbox (minins command) should be  
named "Limit Transition Point Size".

Do not include the "L" in the command line when no value is provided  
for the linkspace size or if it is 0.

For parameters that take a value split them off, for example:

atacs -M4 -tuyspn foo.g

After synthesis, I get a second atacs run with -llodpl before the open  
of the xyz.dot which means I see the LHPN rather than the circuit.   
Viewing circuit should just open the dot file generated by synthesis.
