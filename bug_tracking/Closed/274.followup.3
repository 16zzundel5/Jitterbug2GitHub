As of cvs tag PR274followup3
==========================================================================
Fatal errors in atacs/work/hse:
	atacs -oqtsys alu2    still draws a segmentation fault.
	atacs -oqtsys diffeq3 now draws a segmentation fault.
Therefore, I am moving this report back to Fatal error.
==========================================================================

The good news is that e0, deco1, and domino2 now work!  Thanks!
	(deco1 and domino2 never needed the CSC solver)
I have moved these examples from
	atacs/work/hse
to 	atacs/examples/hse
and added them into the regression suite.

In atacs/work/vhd, using atacs -oqtsys <example>:
test1 gets No solution found  findsv: Unable to solve CSC -- Possible error

In atacs/examples/hse, using atacs -oqtsys <example>:
compenv gets ERROR:45:  ack is not a signal!

In atacs/work/hse, using atacs -oqtsys <example>:
lab3 still produces an empty prs, and I still don't know why.
FF gets No solution found findsv: Unable to solve CSC -- Possible error
gasp3 gets ERROR: Ordering rule violation in state 
postp, deco6, cory are deadlocked in state
alu1 gets ERROR: Safety violation for rule endp+/1 -> endp-/1.
absstari, stari12, stari14, fifoN each run out of memory (256 MB)
sbuf, BUG, diffeq2 each take over 24 hours of cputime

Because of the segmentation faults for alu2 and diffeq3, I am moving
this bug report back to Fatal error, pending resolution.
