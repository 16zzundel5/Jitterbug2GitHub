As it stands now, the entity must match the file name.

If I have two behavioral models for the same entity, normally I would
use the same entity name, but different architecture names.

However, in order for me to synthesize each behavioral circuit with ATACS,
they have to be in different files and I have to make a different entity
for each with a different name for each entity.

It would be nice to split the entity from the architecture name and be
able to specify which architecture to synthesize with which entity rather
than JUST specifying the entity name and having the architecture be
implied as the architecture in that file.
