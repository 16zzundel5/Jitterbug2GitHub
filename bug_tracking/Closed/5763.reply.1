The GUI should not support real numbers for initial values as LPNs ONLY support
integers for initial values.  You 
are confusing the meaning of continuous variable.  A continuous variable does
not mean a real variable, it 
means a variable that changes over time continuously.  While it can take on any
real value, the representation of 
the value is always with a range bounded by integers.  Therefore, unless a
variable has a rate rule, it is not a 
continuous variable.  It is a discrete variable.  Discrete variables are those
which do not evolve continuously and 
their value is only changed by discrete transitions.  

I should though likely convert a real initial value into a bounded range around
that value.
