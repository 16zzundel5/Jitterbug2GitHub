Subject: BUG: saving an analysis view
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>

1) I created a model (model 1) with two species and an activation influence
between them.
2) I created a new model (model 2) with model 1 tiled.
3) I created an analysis view for model 2.  This works fine and the XML
looks good.
4) I then save the analysis view and get a load of "Generated SBML has
errors" errors like "The value of a <speciesReference> 'species' attribute
must be the identifier of an existing <species> in the model."  These are
promoters and RNAP species, from what I can tell.  This error appears twice.
5) I then go into the analysis XML and the promoters and RNAP species aren't
there anymore (everything else seems fine, though).
6) Then, if I save the model 2 gcm (not the analysis view), the species come
back to the XML, though I still get the same error message.
