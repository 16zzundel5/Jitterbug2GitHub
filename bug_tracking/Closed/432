It's a real mess. Let's see if this makes sense:

IF you are in a state where outputs are enabled to change THEN
  IF the state before the previous state (previous previous state) was a conditional (levels present) input burst THEN
    IF the next state contains an unconditional input burst (no level signals) THEN
      FOREACH output "out" enabled to change in the current state DO
        IF "out" is falling in the state after the next state (the next next state) THEN
          set all level signals in the current state to unstable ('X') in the excitation cube for output "out"
        END
      END
    END
  END
END

A slightly simplified version, but perhaps not as robust if we start extending what is allowed
in a burst-mode specification in the future, is the following:

IF you are in a state where outputs are enabled to change THEN
  IF outputs were enabled to change in the previous state THEN
    IF there are no level signals set to '1' or '0' in the next state THEN
      FOREACH output "out" enabled to change in the current state DO
        IF "out" is falling in the state after the next state (the next next state) THEN
          set all level signals in the current state to unstable ('X') in the excitation cube for output "out"
        END
      END
    END
  END
END

Did it finish?
Have you tried the cache controller yet? Remember HFMIN never completed on cdp-p1-xbm
so maybe that example is just too complex for 2-level minimization?
