Subject: BUG: replacedBy gets stuck in component editor
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Whenever a replacedBy (-->) is applied to a port, and then the user
presses OK, the direction (-->) is fixed. If later the user wants to
change the direction, or set to the replacement to "none", the change
does not happen and the direction is fixed to replacedBy.
