k a bit. Many young people have 
enrolled in community colleges and universities. That's one reason a record 
63 percent of adults ages 25 to 29 have spent at least 
some time in college, according to the Pew Research Center.Older Americans 
are returning to school, too. Doug Damato, who lives in Asheville, N.C., 
lost his job as an installer at a utility company in February 
2012. He stopped looking for work last fall, when he began taking 
classes in mechanical engineering at Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community 
College.Next week, Damato, 40, will accept an academic award for earning 
top grades. But one obstacle has emerged: Under a recent change in 
state law, his unemployment benefits will now end July 1, six months 
earlier than he expected.He's planning to work nights, if possible, to support 
himself once the benefits run out. Dropping out of school is "out 
of the question," he said, given the time he has already put 
into the program."I don't want a handout," he says. "I'm trying to 
better myself."Many older Americans who lost their jobs are finding refuge 
in Social Security's disability program. Nearly 8.9 million Americans are 
receiving disability checks, up 1.3 million from when the recession ended 
in June 2009.Natasha Baebler's journey out of the labor force and onto 
the disability rolls began when she lost her job serving disabled students 
and staff members at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., in February 
2012.For six monP Photo/SANA, File)The Associated PressThis citizen journalism

activist during a protest in front of the Grand Mosque in Paris,

freedom for Arab women, were protesting in support of a young Tunisian

PressTUNIS, Tunisia  A 19-year-old Tunisian who bared her breasts and taunted 
Muslim hard-liners says that she fears for her life and wants to 
take refuge abroad.The Ukraine-based group Femen, which stages pranks for 
women's and gay rights, apparently inspired the bold act of the woman 
known only as Amina.  The group held an International Topless Jihad 
day last Thursday in support of Muslim women, including Amina.Amina went 
into hiding after reportedly receiving death threats. But she reappeared 
in an interview broadcast Saturday with the French cable TV station Canal 
Plus at her refuge in a village hours from the Tunisian capital.She 
told Canal Plus that "I must leave Tunisia."Amina said she fears for 
her life in her homeland, but will keep her Femen principles "until 
I'm 80."
