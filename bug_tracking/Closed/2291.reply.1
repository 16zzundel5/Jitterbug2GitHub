I took a look at the sbml file you posted on this bug and could recreate the
error you were getting.  However, the sbml file had four reactions in it that
had no id.  I think that you were getting this error because the tool was
getting confused by which reaction you were selecting.  I deleted the reactions
that had no id from the file and retested and the error went away.  I think
maybe we should make it impossible to get to a state like that by not allowing
sbml files that are missing ids to be imported.
