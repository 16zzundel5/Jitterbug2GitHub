I've implemented the no explicit promoters shall appear in the promoter lis=
t of an implicit promoter influence policy.

Also, Tyler, I figured out why you were unable to disable the promoter comb=
o box for an explicit promoter and had to resort to hiding it--it's because=
 I had code that enabled the promoter box for influences whose type was set=
 to activation or repression and disabled it for influences whose type was =
set to complex or no influence.  That's all sorted out now.

All that remains is to eliminate the notion of a default promoter, since cu=
rrently each activating, repressing, and complex influence dropped between =
two species creates a new non-default promoter.  Dropping complex influence=
s shouldn't really create a promoter, though, so we might introduce the con=
cept of "Promoter none" for naming non-influences and complex influences, e=
.g. "A +> B, Promoter none."  Currently their promoters are set to default,=
 which has no effect on behaviour, but isn't the best descriptor either.

I think that explicit promoters should not appear in the list of
promoter choices for implicit promoter edges.  This is actually
described in the original bug report early on but got lost in all the
replies, I think.
