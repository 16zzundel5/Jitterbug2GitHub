Do we want algebraic rules at all?

Algebraic rules should be consistent under dimensional analysis.

variable for assignment and rate rules must not be constant and units
must be consistent between math and the variable.

assignmentRules and rateRules are not allowed on species used in
reactions unless the boundaryCondition variable is true.

There can only be one assignmentRule OR rateRule per variable.

There cannot be both an assignmentRule and initialRule on the same
variable.

Units of rate rule are those of the variable over time.

Model must not contain algebraic loops

Model must not be overdetermined by the algebraic equations
