There were a couple of problems here.  

1) The extra variable parameter did not have a value set.  This worked before
because it had a default of 0, but default is now NaN.

2) There were problems with the new event semantics.  I've changed the code to
use the new libsbml constructs to update the event semantics.

I've checked in these fixes, please check them out.
