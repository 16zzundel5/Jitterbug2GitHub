It no longer crashes, but it does not appear to work.  Try using rkf45 to see the behavior.  The speciesReferenceId should actually be tracked as part of the state, see how you can graph in in the rkf45 simulator.  When it gets updated, the reaction rate should actually change.  Notice the bend in the curve using rkf45.  I'm pretty sure there are test cases which test this in the suite.
