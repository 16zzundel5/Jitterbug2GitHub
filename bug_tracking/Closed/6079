Farmer's Market salad.  Nothing beats freshly made mozzarella.  I think the ricotta is as well because of the very creamy consistency, almost like a burratta, unlike the store bought kind.  The spiciness of the arugula complemented the three cheeses.  Oh, and the crust...nothing compares to it.  I want an outdoor oven in my backyard...it's actually in my backorder list.    A glass of Pino Grigio for me and ice cold beer for the hubs.  Then spent a couple of hours at the Science Center....awesome day! Was the perfect timing a fluke, to get in that quickly and not having to sit around to wait?   Although, by the time we were done eating (2:30pm) there was a crowd outside already forming.   We shall see next time! I'd heard that this place had the. best. pizza. (yes, like that), so I was prepared for disappointment, and I wasn't disappointed. I arrived at about 3pm on a Monday and didn't have to wait at all. There are tables outside but they don't let you eat there -- not really sure what the deal is there... I guess maybe when things are busy that's where people wait? Anyway, it was a nice enough day, I leashed the pup outside and grabbed a seat at the bar where I could keep an eye on him. Simple menu, with only a few options. I did the biancoverde (ricotta & arugula). It was excellent. You really can taste the difference when the best ingredients are used -- almost on par with my aunt's famous homemade version. Which I guess is a pretty amazing feat for a restaurant. Still, it was just pizza. In fairness, I'm not sure what I was expecting -- to somehow have my mind blown by how great it was or what. It definitely isn't worth making a trip just to eat here, but it's definitely a great stop if you live or find yourself in the area. I'll be honest, I'm not quite sure this place is all it's hyped up to be. I mean, it's definitely fresh and good but I'm glad I didn't have to wait too long to get in. I have had better pizza before. for sure. We were quoted a 45 minute to hour wait. No problem, we chilled at the bar next door and played a make shift
