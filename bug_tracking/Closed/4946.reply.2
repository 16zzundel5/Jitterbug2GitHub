Subject: Re: CHANGE: random initial values (PR#4946)
Date: Wed May 12 01:05:56 2010

Translator.java is now capable of analyzing initial variables with ranges using
the following short term fix. 
Short term fix: 
1. Extract the lower and upper bounds and set the initial value to the mean. 			
					
2. Anything that involves infinity, take either the lower or upper bound which
is not infinity.  
3. If both are infinity, set to 0.
