Hi Professor,
Thank you for the reply.  I think you are exactly right.  The file is
'Working.xml' in the project that I submitted on canvas last night.   I see
a reaction 'Complex_16' in the tabular view that does not exist in the
graphical view.  When I attempt to remove it, I get the same exception and
it doesn't delete the reaction.

I'm not actually sure that what I did is going to accomplish my goal.
 Basically I need to model formation of 7-mers of DnaA_ATP binding
cooperatively to 4 distinct sites.  The cooperation is based on how many
many molecules are bound individually at each site as well as the number
bound at the other 3 sites.  I was going to attempt this using events to
set the rate constants, but I'm not sure that's possible.  Perhaps I should
come to your office hours to discuss it?

I have a vague idea of how the error happened, but no idea if I could
recreate it.  In that file, I have DnaA_ATP polymerizing at 4 different
sites (R1-R4).  I had already entered the formation arrows for all the
reactions at R1 and the species at R2.  When I clicked one of the species
in the R2 polymerization, I think I accidentally got an arrow that was
behind it and got an error that I couldn't move that edge.  However, after
closing the error message I saw a complex formation arrow from DnaA_ATP to
the species I tried to move.  After adding arrows to the other species in
the R2 polymerization, I noticed that the magically created arrow had gone
missing, and recreated it.  I am guessing that 'Complex_16' is the
mysterious arrow.

Thank you,
- Ted
