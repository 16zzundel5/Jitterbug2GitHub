Remaining issues;

Do we want algebraic rules at all?
 
Algebraic rules should be consistent under dimensional analysis.

variable for assignment and rate rules must not be constant and units
must be consistent between math and the variable.

Units of rate rule are those of the variable over time.

Model must not contain algebraic loops - not checking initial assignments yet.

Model must not be overdetermined by the algebraic equations
