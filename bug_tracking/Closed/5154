Subject: BUG: Problems with converting stoichiometry math from sbml level 2
 version 4
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=00c09f955c9409db19049197e212

I created an SBML file with stoichiometry math in several reactions in sbml
level 2 version 4. When I loaded it into the iBioSim editor with sbml level
3, for each reaction that had stoichiometry math, the stoichiometry math was
replaced by stoichiometry with NAN as its value and a rule was created in
the List of Rules. However, the Kinetic law that was generated always
complained about the units mismatch. For example, the CI dimerization
reaction had nd=2 as its stoichiometry math for reactant CI. When I opened
it in the current version of iBioSim, the rule "generatedId_0=nd" was
created. The Kinetic Law generated by "Use Mass Action" was
kdf*pow(CI,generatedId_0)-kdr*CI2. The error message then popped up saying
"Kinetic law units should be substance/time", when I tried to save the
reaction. However, if the Kinetic law was manually changed
to kdf*pow(CI,2)-kdr*CI2, the editor would treat it as a valid one.
