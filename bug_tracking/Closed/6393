Subject: CHANGE: Guarantee execution of transitions compiled from non-blocking
 assignments in VHDL
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

The VHDL compiler compiles a non-blocking assignment into a dangling
LPN transition. We need to guarantee that this assignment is executed
before the execution of its subsequent transitions. For example, the
following VHDL statements "fail_to_route <= one_flit; wait for
delay(1, 1);" are compiled into two transitions, the first statement
becomes a transition with zero delay and an assignment to
"fail_to_route", but it is a dangling; and the second statement
compiles into a transition with uniform(1,1) delay. For untimed state
exploration, these two transitions appear concurrent, and there is no
guarantee that the assignment gets executed.
