Subject: Re: BUG: should allow overwrite of a DNA component when not referenced (PR#5468)

Done, moving to needs testing.  Also made it so that there won't be any
complaints when saving out SBOL from a GCM that has a promoter with no product
species. (Promoter is simply not included when synthesizing new DNA component.)
