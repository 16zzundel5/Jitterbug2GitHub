This is close just a couple changes.  First, the last file on the atacs command
line should be the main file.  In other words:

atacs <switches> <component1> ... <componentn> <main vhdl file> <component>

Second, do not use a general file browser for adding to the components.  Only
allow vhd files in the current project to be allowed components.
