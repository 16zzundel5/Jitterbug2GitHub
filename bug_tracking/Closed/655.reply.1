The problem was in get_causal_events.  When checking if an event can ever be
causal in the future, it would check if it is_level_matched.  The problem is
that a sequencing event would always fail this check.  Therefore, it would purge
sequencing events too soon potentially.  Therefore, it now checks if it is
either a sequencing event OR is_level_matched.
