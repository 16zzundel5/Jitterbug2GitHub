Prime Minister and other Turkish officials on efforts to halt the violence

released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, Syrian President Bashar 
Assad gestures speaks at the Opera House in central Damascus, Syria. Assad 
has warned that the fall of his regime or the  breakup 
of Syria will unleash a wave of instability that will shake the 
Middle East for years to come. Assad told the Turkish TV station 
Ulusal Kanal in an interview aired Friday, April 5, 2013 that "we 
are surrounded by countries that help terrorists and allow them to enter 
Syria." (AMay 8, 2012: Sen. Charles Schumer speaks to reporters following a weekly 
strategy luncheon.APSen. Chuck Schumer said Sunday he's hoping for a bipartisan 
deal by the end of this week on a sweeping immigration bill 
to secure the border and allow eventual citizenship to the estimated 11 
million people living here illegally."All of us have said that there will 
be no agreement until the eight of us agree to a big, 
specific bill, but hopefully we can get that done by the end 
of the week," said Schumer, D-N.Y., who's leading efforts by eight senators 
to craft the legislation. "That's what we're on track to do."Schumer spoke 
on CBS' "Face the Nation" alongside Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another leader 
of the immigration talks, who suggested there could be a tough road 
ahead for the contentious legislation."There will be a great deal of unhappiness 
about this proposal because everybody didn't get what they wanted," McCain 
said. "There are entrenched positions on both sides of this issue as 
far as business and labor."A deal on immigration is a top second-term 
priority for President Barack Obama, and his senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer 
said Sunday that the bill being developed in the Senate is completely 
consistent Obama's approach -- even though the Senate plan would tie border 
security to a path to citizenship in a manner Obama administration officials 
have criticized.Pfeiffer didn't answer directly when asked on "Fox News 
Sunday" whether Obama woulFILE: December 17, 2012: Women carry packages into the James A. Farley 
Post Office Building in New York City.REUTERSThe financially strapped U.S. 
Postal Service is running into opposition from historic preservationists 
as the agency tries to cut losses by selling off buildings.The postal 
service lost $15.9 billion last year, after losing $5.1 billion in 2011 
-- as online services continue to replace money-making mail deliveries.Hundreds 
of post offices are on the National Register of Historic Places, which 
largely protects them from being demolished, or are protected under deals 
with new owners.But preservationists point out some of the 600 post offices 
earmarked for disposal in the agencys fiscal 2012 report could have historical 
significance and be sold.Steve Hutkins, a New York University professor 
who runs the website Save the Post Office, told FoxNews.com the number 
for sale might be closer to 200 because about 400 would be 
lease terminations, yet he remains skeptical.The New York Times reports 
11 historic post offices are now on the market, including ones in 
Santa Monica, Calif., and Norwich, Conn.While many of the buildings are 
most known for the exterior architectural designs, more than 1,000 have 
Art-Deco-era murals of potential value, the result of the federal government 
commissioning artists during the 1930s Depression.Bernard Perlin, who as
