When postprocessing is on, this example produce the wrong level expression
between b+ and c+ should have level [d].

module ex1;

input  a = {false};
input  b = {false};
output c = {false};
output d = {false};
output x = {false};

process ex1;
*[[ skip -> a+; b+; [d]; c+; [~d]; a-
  | skip -> b+; c+
 ]; b-; c- ]
endprocess

gate dout1;
a & b -> x+
~a | ~b -> x-
endgate

gate dout;
x & ~c -> d+
~x | c -> d-
endgate
endmodule
