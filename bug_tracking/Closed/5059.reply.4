Subject: Re: BUG: orginal sets parameter to default value (PR#5059)

Now that I've done some simulations, I've found that the basic bug still hasn't
been fixed.  While setting a parameter to original appears to change it to the
original custom parameter in the GCM, the behavior generated when simulating is
still that of the default GCM parameter.
