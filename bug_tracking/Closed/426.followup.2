Oops, I spoke to soon.  It is repeatable.  If you give ATACS the following
command line on a file with a syntax error:

atacs -lv -msmEmX -ya -sv lab_hse wineshop

Then first, the syntax error is correctly identified.  However, ATACS does
not stop execution once it finds the syntax error.  Rather, it moves
forward to finish processing the command list.  Thus, it cores when the
TEL for the wineshop is incomplete.

Here is the output from ATACS:

shang:~/work/vhdl> atacs -lv -msmEmX -ya -sv lab_hse wineshop
ATACS VERSION 4.1
Logging session in:  atacs.log
Compiling lab_hse.vhd ...

wineshop.vhd: 17: syntax error.
ERROR: Compilation failed due to above errors.
ERROR:  Cannot access lab_hse.tel!

You can use any hierarchical file in VHDL inserting a syntax error into
the module you are trying to synthesize to recreate the core.
