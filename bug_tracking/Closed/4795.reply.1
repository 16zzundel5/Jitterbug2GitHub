viewLog in verification was being enabled by default. So, changed it to not
enabled by default. It should probably see whether a log file exists & set the
appropriate status.
A viewModel() method should be present inside the Verification.java &
synthesis.java. So, upon clicking the viewModel-Using graphviz/browser, it would
be clear to the BioSim gui which file to open.
