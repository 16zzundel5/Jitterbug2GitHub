Subject: Re: FEATURE: new transform to combine transitions (PR#4982)

This now seems to be working correctly.  The delay looks better than it did, but
it still isn't pretty.  I am still 
combining transitions pairwise, but I believe that it is working correctly.  Let
me know if you seen any problems, 
and I will look at generalizing it for combining multiple parallel transitions.
