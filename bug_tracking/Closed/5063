In the GCM editor, changing the degree of multimerization (nd) for a biochemical influence does not have the expected effect on SBML reactions generated from the GCM. No matter what nd is, a simple pair of biochemical influences A +> O and B +> O on promoter P will always result in a biochemical reaction with the forward rate term Kb*A*B, the product 1.0 Biochemical_A_B, and the reactants 1.0 A, 1.0 B. If the dimerization of each species making up the biochemical species was taken into account, then the forward term would be Kb*A_2* B_2, the product 1.0 Biochemical_A_2_B_2, and the reactants 1.0 A_2, 1.0 B_2. Interestingly, while dimerization reactions for A and B are in the SMBL file, also present are activation binding reactions involving A_2 and B_2. This means that the promoter can be activated by either A_2, B_2, or Biochemical_A_B, when really it should just be activated by the currently nonexistent species Biochemical_A_2_B_2.
