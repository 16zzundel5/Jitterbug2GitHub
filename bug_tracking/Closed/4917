Hi,

We have decided to make a few changes to the grammar to make things  
more consistent to the paper as well as better situated for conversion  
to SBML.

1) and -> AND
2) or -> OR
3) xor -> XOR
4) not -> NOT
5) Add INT(e)
6) Change bitwise operator from "e[e]" to "BIT(e,e)"

The first 5 should be fairly straightforward.  Robert should be able  
to help you with the 6th item.

Cheers,

Chris
