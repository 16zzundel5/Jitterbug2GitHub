I found the issue with TIC in BAG.  Wendy's function geom_make_new_clocks
was adding $a back into the zone after $c fired, so after firing $c, $a or
$b were allowed to fire---oops!  It seems to work now, although I fixed it
by setting a bit in the confl_removed_bv for the stack frame that allows  
$b to fire.  I cannot say that I entirely understand the role of
confl_removed_bv, but it seems to have done the trick by preventing
geom_make_new_clocks from adding a clock for $a back into the zone after $c
fires.
