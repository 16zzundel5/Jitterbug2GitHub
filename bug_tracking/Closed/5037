Subject: FEATURE: add ability to select signals to interleave in model generation
Date: Tue, 29 Jun 2010 12:51:51 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

Add to the GUI, the ability to select which signals to interleave  
during model generation.

Only create new places when there are changes on the signals that are  
to be interleaved.  The enabling condition should be the net change in  
the input values since the last place created, and the outputs changed  
should include assignments to any variable that has changed since the  
last place was added as well as an assignment to the next output  
change if one is coming up next.
