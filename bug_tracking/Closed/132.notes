The code is now configured to find the first least cube/literal cost
combinational cover for each transition.  To test, run ATACS with the BDD
switch
and the verbose switch.  The combinational covers will appear in the file
_design_.MAP.  To compare against the explicit code, run atacs with the
multicube and atomic switches, and look at the _design_.prs file.
