Hi Dr. Myers,

I will try this a little bit later today and let you know how it goes.  Thanks for the advice!

Can you try to run the GeneNet tool from the command line?  Sounds like it is
perhaps not working on your
system.  You should be able to go to the BioSim/bin directory and just try to
run the executable.  Let me know
what happens.

Thanks,

Chris
