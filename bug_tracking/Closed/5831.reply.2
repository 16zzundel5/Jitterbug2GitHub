Hi,

I think I figured this one out.  I get the same exception when I create two
species with a complex formation 
reaction between them.  Then, I create a third species and try to move it over
the complex formation reaction.  If I 
drop it while the complex formation reaction is highlighted, it tries to connect
this species in which causes it to 
crash.  I've added a check to prevent this from happening which will be in the
new version released soon.  Please 
let me know if this is fixed in version 2.4.2.

Thanks for finding this subtle bug.

Chris
