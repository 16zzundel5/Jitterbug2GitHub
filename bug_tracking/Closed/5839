Subject: FEATURE auto-regulation learning

In learning models, auto-regulation is currently ignored because it can't
be separated from degradation.  However, I propose that degradation should
be linear with concentration whereas auto-regulation should have a
concentration dependence.  This feature allows the two to be separated.

One simple implementation of this is to look at the probability that a
species, S, is increasing as a function of its concentration (in the same
way that is currently done for two species, but now with only a single
one). If the change from low to mid concentration is the same as the change
from mid to high concentration, it is expected that degradation is the only
factor.  If not, it would be expected that auto-regulation is also factor.
Best,
- Ted
