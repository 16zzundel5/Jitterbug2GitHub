I don't think so.  I think the reason for this was likely so you could get the list of species for interesting species.  We can try not generating :-).

> I talked with Jason today about this.  When an analysis view is opened, an SBML file is generated from the top level GCM model and dropped into the analysis view folder.  Jason also seemed to think that this is the SBML that is used for analysis so any changes made in the parameter editor are not reflected in the simulation.  I'm not sure about this as I thought that the SBML is generated upon clicking "Save and Run", but I do know that the SBML file is generated when the view is opened and for very large models, this can cause iBioSim to hang for a few seconds.  I don't think the SBML needs to be generated upon opening anymore, so I think that we should be able to only generate when we run analyses.  Can you think of any reason why the SBML needs to be generated upon opening an analysis view?
