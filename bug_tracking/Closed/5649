When you save a model that has SBOL annotations, create an SBOL composite component and save it in a new file with the same name and ".sbol" extension as the existing file.  Also, add an SBOL annotation to the model with the newly create URI for the composite.

Remove save SBOL from menu as it is no longer needed.
