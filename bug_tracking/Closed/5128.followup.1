Works better but when I select just regA, it goes into an infinite loop.

Also, when you pick some other signals, you get interesting results.   
I'm not sure they are wrong, however.  More graph remains then seems  
necessary, but strictly speaking, I think it may be correct.  We may  
have other transforms that are possible.  You can try "temp" and you  
find more graph than is needed remains.  You can also try adc_start,  
ADR3, etc.  I think the issue might be loops with no assignments but  
do have an enabling condition.  I think these can be eliminated  
because they can be thought safely as a [0,inf] loop with true  
enabling conditions.
