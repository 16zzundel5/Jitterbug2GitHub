Chris,

I definitely think that this would be helpful.  One of the constraints that we
have for our circuits is that the data signal must be updated before the phase
signal, so it sounds like we could use this to check.  So if there is some way
to do it in VHDL, it would be very helpful.

Thanks,
Michael Boyer
