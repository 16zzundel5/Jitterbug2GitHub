There is still a remaining issue.  The index can be arbitrary math.  When I try to use: "i+1" and "j+1", the index gets lost.  This appears to be a problem not only with events but also any place there is an index.  You should make sure that the annotation creation and parsing is able to handle math and not just a variable here.
