Xatacs is now broken, probably because it doesn't yet know about the new flags
for atacs.  The first symptom is that
=====================================
520 xia:examples/hse> Xatacs
ERROR:  Need to load file first!
ERROR:  Need to load file first!
ERROR:  Need to load file first!
=====================================
comes out before I even do anything. 
If I then load a file, almost everything I can click or choose results in 
INVALID COMMAND
That part has to be becuase it doesn't know about the new switches.
