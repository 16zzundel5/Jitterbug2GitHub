The speciesType and compartment pair of every species must be unique.

initialConcentration is not allowed if species is in a 0-dim
compartment.  

Only one of initialAmount or initialConcentration but none is also okay.
In this case, hasOnlySubstanceUnits must be used.

If constant is true, can only be changed by initialAssignment.

units of initialAmount are substanceUnits while initialConcentration are
substanceUnits/size with size defined by its compartment.

units must be dimensionless, mole, item, kilogram, gram, or units
derived from these.  default is built-in substance.

constant and boundary conditions determine if species can be used in
assignment, rate rule, reactant, or product, and if it can be changed by
reactions or rules (but not both) and events.  (see Table 5 in SBML
document).
