I checked in corrections that should fix the sad and user-defined data
path problems.  However, I'm not sure they completely work. 

The problem is basically that the user-defined data file was getting
loaded twice, but the second time was not using the full path.  For now,
the second load is squashed.  However, it should read from the full
path.  This would be useful if someone provided a properties file with a
different name than user-defined.dat.  I tried checking this by changing
the properties file to "temp.dat" and then moving the file to "temp.dat"
but then I get a unable to load properties file error which seems really
strange.  It seems that it is not happy to read a properties file that I
have touched.  Or maybe I'm doing something wrong when I edit the file.

Curtis: please see "CHECK" in Reb2Sac.java, and let me know if you see
any problems.
