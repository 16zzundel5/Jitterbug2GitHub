I agree. The initial value of a continuous variable in the graphical editor
in BioSim now supports rational numbers. We probably do not need to support
irrational numbers (like pi, sqareroot(2) etc). The converted LPN however
still accept integers as initial values. Also, unless a rate rule is
associated with a continuous variable in the graphical editor, the
converted LPN still treats a continuous variable as an integer.
