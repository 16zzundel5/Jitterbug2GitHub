Hi Curtis,

The sbml wasn't imported, though.  I hand created it using the tool,
adding species and reactions through the editor.  If there was an
error, it must've occurred during the creation processes, but I'm not
sure where or how to recreate it.  Several reactions gave very weird
error messages when I tried to save them, and so this might be part of
where the error is happening.

cheers,
Nam
