Subject: BUG: Abstraction options in the verification view are not saved
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

If one first removes certain preprocess, main loop, or postprocess
abstraction methods listed, then closes and reopens the verification
view, any of these options kept before are lost, and all available
methods in these three categories are listed again.
