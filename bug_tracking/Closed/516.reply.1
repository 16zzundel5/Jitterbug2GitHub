The problem was that atacs/examples/regress was relying on pstree to
report the arguments passed to CVS.  Unfortuneately, if this argument
string is too long, pstree simply reports "..."

I fixed this by changing atacs/examples/regress to use ps instead.
Furthermore, it now assumes that if the commit is coming from emacs,
exactly one file is being committed, and that that file name is simply
the last word that got passed to CVS.

I believe this is fixed as of cvs tag GOOD251.

I will now move this report to Needs Testing.

Please look in the Needs Testing section of the JitterBug web page.
For any reports that were initially submitted by you, please test them
out to see if they are really fixed.  If and when you agree that a
given report is really fixed, please move it to Closed.

Thanks!
