Subject: BUG: Cancel button not closing the SBOL URI prefix window on opening
 existing BioSim project (unstable bug)
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

When opening an existing project, an empty SBOL file with the project
name was created. On clicking this SBOL file, a pop-up window appeared
to ask the user to provide a URI prefix for this SBOL file, and the
default was www.dummy.org. The cancel button on this window does not
quit it. This bug, however, only appeared once, and it disappeared in
subsequent tries.
