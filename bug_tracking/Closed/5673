Subject: BUG:  reb2sac referencing 32-bit libraries in 64-bit install

reb2sac from the 64-bit Fedora installer was not working for Hiro on 64-bit
Ubuntu until he installed a package to support 32-bit libraries.  This is
strange because the reb2sac in the 64-bit install works for me on 64-bit Fedora
16.
