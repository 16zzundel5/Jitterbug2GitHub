In the SBML editor you can create different compartments, but when you
put species into different compartments it still displays all species in
the box on the right.  It would be nice for organizational purposes to
be able to click on a particular compartment and just see the species in
that compartment, and if you want to look at all of the species, then
click on a compartment called 'all'.
