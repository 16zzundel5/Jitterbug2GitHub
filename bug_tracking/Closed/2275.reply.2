The data structures that are used were trying to match what we said
they were in the conference paper, and then, extended somewhat to the
dissertation structures.

However, some things are still confusing because they are not renamed.

For example, a set represents species that influence a species of
interest.  A double set represents the set of possible species that
influence a species of interest.  NetCon contains all the connections
for the network.  So, to add background knowledge, you probably need
to create a set containing the background knowledge, then stick it
into the appropriate species' set or double set.

I hope that helps a little.
