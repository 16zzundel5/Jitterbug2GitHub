Division event duplicates the component and executes the event assignments to determine the values as follows:

1) Compartment size specified in an event assignment is the size of the parent and child's size is the current size minus the size of the parent (default is divide by 2) unless it is constant, and the size is copied from parent to child.

2) Species is the same as compartment size except the default for boundary species is to copy parent value into child.

3) Parameters are copied from parent to child unless there is an event assignment which would set its value.

Death events simply remove a component from simulation.
