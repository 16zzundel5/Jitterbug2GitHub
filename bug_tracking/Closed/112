I made a STG example. ATACS has a problem to verify the synthesized circuit
for the specification with "orbits"

1) Verification did not complete error for the following commands:
    > heuristic
    > loadg *.g
    > doall
    > verify

2) Segmentation error 
    > heuristic
    > loadg *.g
    > gatelevel
    > doall
    > verify

The STG is as follows:

    

.inputs a d e f s x
.outputs z
#@.init_state [1000000]
.graph
a+ z+
z+ x+
x+ s+/1 d+
s+/1 e+

.marking {<a+,z+>}
.end
