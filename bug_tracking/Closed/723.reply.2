Ok, I think this is fixed now, and the other issue is also taken care.  Namely,
when a signal does not appear on a components interface, this can be for two
reasons:

1) It is an internal signal of the component.
2) It is a port (or internal signal) of another component which is not visible
to the selected component.

For case 1, 

atacs -lv makes the signals type OUT | ISIGNAL
atacs -oalv also makes the signal type OUT | ISIGNAL

For case 2,

atacs -lv makes the signal type IN
atacs -oalv makes the signal type DUMMY

Let me know if there are any further problems.
