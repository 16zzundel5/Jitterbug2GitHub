Subject: Re: BUG: need support for ranges of initial rates (PR#5298)
Date: Thu Apr 14 06:08:50 2011

Code has been added to support initial range in Translator.java. One temporary
hack to enter initial range to 
variable panel is to disable the error messages generated by the two "if"
conditions between line 219 and 236 in 
VariablePanel.java. A separate bug report has been submitted to the database
regarding this problem.
