I'm going to need some more info on this one:

There seems to have been added "Pdimension" and "Rdimension" that I did not
add.
This isn't a big deal, I just have no knowledge about it or it's purpose.

The big thing though is clarification on how many places in the code need the
gui to be changed. It's a massive page and I can scan it myself and mark places
that potentially need to be changed, then we can go over it together later.

Other than that the gui is set and ready for replication.
