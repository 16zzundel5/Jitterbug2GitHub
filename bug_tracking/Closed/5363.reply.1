Hi Nicolas,

The problem with this one appears to be because we used a hard coded web address
to find the biomodels online.  However, at some point they moved.  I've now
changed it so that is uses the web service code to get the file which should
solve this problem in the next release.  For now, you will need to use import. 
By the way, if you see problems with this in the future, please let us know.

iBioSim will load any level/version combination of SBML file, but it immediately
converts it to either L2V4 or L3V1.  The decision of which to convert to is set
in the preferences under the SBML Preferences tab.  Note that we up-convert
only.  This means if you import a L3V1 file even in L2V4 mode, it will not
attempt to down convert and instead leave it as an L3V1 file.  Therefore, when
we save an SBML file, it will always save in either L2V4 or L3V1 depending on
the mode and the original file type.  

The "Save SBML File" menu option is only supposed to be active for GCM files. 
It allows you to convert a GCM file to an SBML file.  Therefore, it is not
intended for your desired purpose.  We have actually removed this option, and
the GCM to SBML translation is now done through the analysis view.  

We could easily add an export option for older SBML level/versions, but we do
not currently support this.

Cheers,

Chris
