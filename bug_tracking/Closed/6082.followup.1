There is a flaw in the idea of the dimensionCounter.  If you enter a bad formula and get an error message the dimension id counter keeps counting up and you get new dimension id numbers.

I understand the goal is to keep unique, so we need a scheme to make unique.  Also the scheme should be easy for users to understand.  Maybe they could get a unique prefix.

d# - top element dimension
rd# - reactant dimension
pd# - product dimension
md# - modifier dimension
ed# - event assignment dimension

All dimension ids start now at 0.

Is this clear?

Chris
