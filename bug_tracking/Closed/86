When I use the following commands, ATACS seems to produce wrong ".ver" file
for some ".er" specifications converted from ".g" files.

Commands :
   atacs> heuristic
   atacs> doall chu133
   atacs> orbits
   atacs> verify

The errors can be classified as 3 groups as follows:

1) For the following specifications, ORBITS produces verification error trace.
   chu133.g, chu150.g, converta.g, hazard.g, ram-read-sbuf.g, vbe5b.g
   wrdata.g

2) For the master-read.g
   ORBITS did not complete.
   Error message is "not a wire! : di "

3) For the sbuf-ram-write.g
   ORBITS did not complete.
   Error message is " (wire done 1) 'wire arelady has a different value' "
