Hi,

If you're fighting depression, you probably think a lot.

You think about the reasons you are depressed and you
 think about what you can do to get over your depression.
.... You may find that you tell yourself the story of your 
depression over and over because you think it will help 
you to deal with it better.
You think about what other people think of you, and
 you avoid being around them because you think they 
will notice there is something "wrong" with you.

If you're in therapy...

....there's a good chance that all of this thinking about

depression is encouraged by a well-meaning counselor 
who asks you to evaluate your feelings and your thoughts about your feelings.

How is this working for you?

The truth is that you can probably help your
 depression more if you stop thinking about it!

In fact, many of the things depression suffers do, as well as
 the things they avoid, probably contribute more to depression than they help.

For example, 

If you're invited out for the evening, you probably don't go.

....Perhaps your decision not to go is preceded by thinking of
 dozens of reasons why you should not go or why it won't be fun.

But what if you could just get up and go and know that you
 would be able to enjoy yourself?

In "End Your Depression," you will discover the ways that many
people unknowingly keep depression going, even while trying to "treat it."

You will also find out what you can do differently, including 
five simple steps that you can take to begin to feel better right now, one step at a time.
