Yes.  However, overall, the examples in this bug report did not fare
very well.
The good news is that hse/mul1.hse now works and I have added
atacs/examples/hse/mul1.prs.night as of cvs tag mul1pchbASEwork.

Also pchbASE.hse now works.  However, this example has been modified
by hand since the original bug report and doesn't need the CSC
solver.  Furthermore, running the current code with -tsys on the old
version of the example doesn't invoke the CSC solver either. 
Nevertheless, I have added atacs/examples/hse/pchbASE.prs.night as of
cvs tag mul1pchbASEwork.

As of cvs tag PR274followup1:

hse/lab3.hse now produces a .prs file.  However, that .prs file is
empty.  lab3 is supposed to be a state machine that interacts with its
environment.  Looking at the hse file, I don't see why it should lead
to an empty result.

hse/alu2.hse now draws a segmentation fault.

hse/{e0,postp,sbuf}.hse and vhd/test1.vhd have ... enabled but signal
is not ...:
hse/e0.log:ERROR: CSC0-/1 enabled but signal is not 1 or F in state
110F0
hse/postp.log:ERROR: CSC0+/1 enabled but signal is not 0 or R in state
10R001
hse/sbuf.log:ERROR: CSC0-/1 enabled but signal is not 1 or F in state
111010
vhd/test1.log:ERROR: CSC0-/1 enabled but signal is not 1 or F in state
0010110

hse/{compenv,deco1,domino2,simple}.hse are deadlocked in state

hse/{deco6,alu1,cory}.hse have Safety violations

hse/{absstari,stari1[24],gasp3}.hse run out of memory (256 MB)

hse/{BUG,FF,diffeq[23],fifoN}.hse now each take more than 24 hours of
cpu time.


I am moving this report to Incorrect Behavior, pending resolution.
