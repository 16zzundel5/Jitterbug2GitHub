This should be done, moving to needs testing.  I've modified the form

kd_LacI * LacI_total/(1+Kc*IPTG_total) + kd_complex * LacI_total * (1 -
1/(1+Kc*IPTG_total))

to the equivalent form

(kd_LacI + kd_complex * Kc * IPTG_total) * LacI_total / (1 + Kc * IPTG_total)

which is much easier to generate when our example is expanded to multiple
sequestering species.
