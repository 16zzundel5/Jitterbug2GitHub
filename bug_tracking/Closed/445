Subject: vhdl support for gates (decomposing by hand)

Does atacs support gate specifications such as: 
HSE:::::::::::::::::::::;:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::;
gate aibar;
  ( ~a0 & ~a1 ) -> aibar+
  ( a0 | a1 ) -> aibar-
endgate
gate bibar;
  ( ~b0 & ~b1 ) -> bibar+
  ( b0 | b1 ) -> bibar-
endgate

this is the same as
VHDL:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
aibar <= a0 nor a1;
bibar <= b0 nor b1;

Plus I want to specify c-element behavior as a gate - not a process.

I attempted this:
  creset : process
  begin
    if (c0 = '0') and (c1 = '0') then
      assign(cr, '1', 200, 300);
    else
      assign(cr, '0', 200, 300);
    end if;
  end process;
But it gives me:
ERROR: cr_the_and2+/1 enabled but signal is not 0 or R in state 0R0RR11001

I think I can specify gates in a process only if I have the vacuous assign
statement.  But this may cause NO-WAIT deadlock when simulating vhdl
because of the lack of wait statements when vacuous assigns are skipped
over.

I don't know how to specify plainjane vhdl gates in an ATACS-friendly way.
