When the compiler generates constraint rules
it needs to specify bounds of [0, infinity] if
no bounds are given.  Currently it is generating
bounds of 0,0, which causes a verification failure.
The problem can be avoided with postprocessing in 
this example, so it needs to be run with postprocess
off.
