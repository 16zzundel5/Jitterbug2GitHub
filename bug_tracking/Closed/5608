When you drop a constraint, it defaults math "true".  When you change the math, add connections to the constraint automatically.

When you drop a rule, it defaults to an algebraic rule 0=0.  When you change the math, add connections to the rule automatically.  Need to also be able to change the rule time and have it change visually.  

When you drop an event, it defaults to an trigger false.  When you change the event, add connection to the event automatically.
