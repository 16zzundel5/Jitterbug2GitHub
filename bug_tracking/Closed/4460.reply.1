Hi Curtis,

I made several changes to improve iBioSim look and feel on the mac.  One of them
was dealing with preferences, 
so I went ahead and added support for them.  I believe that this completes all
the outstanding 1.0 issues.  I will 
double check though.  Let's talk on Monday about where to go next.

Chris
