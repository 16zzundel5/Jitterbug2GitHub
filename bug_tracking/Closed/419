Probably a feature request.

1) Vacuous assign that has the if clause in the guard.

2) Regular assign that asserts failure upon attempted vacuous assign.

I got the latest handshake package and changed assign to assert failure
for my project, and it works great.

My assigns do require the (lower, upper, scale) though because I like it.
