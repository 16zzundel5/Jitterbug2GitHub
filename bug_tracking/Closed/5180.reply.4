Do not label arc from species to promoter.

Cannot edit promoters.

Cannot edit any influences that are connected to promoters.  

Should only get the influence editor when clicking on influence between
promoters and species, never promoter editor.

Type of influences from promoter to species should be a new type "Production".

Type of species to promoter should not be allowed to be complex type.
