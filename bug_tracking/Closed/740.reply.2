I see at least one case where the new circuit is incorrect:

For the active passive buffer, the command is
../../bin/atacs winery.vhd wine_shopAP.vhd patron.vhd APtop.vhd AP
-oioqtbG1-2ys

The old circuit was:
[ l_rcv: (~r_send)] Combinational
[ r_send: (r_rcv)] Combinational

The new circuit is:
[~r_send: (~r_rcv)] Combinational

It completely removed the l_rcv output.


As for the reproducibility of the bug:

Did the make clean make a difference?  If so, that doesn't bode well
for the atacs/src/Makefile, but it will be hard to track down, since
we no longer have the state from before the make clean.

If not, here are some ways to double check that you are in sync: From
your atacs directory, try cvs -fnq update -r BAD826 -P This will not
actually change any files (because of the -n option to cvs) but it
will report which files if any are out of sync with that tag.  If that
command produces any output at all, you're not completely in sync with
that tag.

The most thorough way to reproduce the bug, is to create a fresh
directory somewhere else, and check out atacs as of that tag: In some
directory under nobackup, you could try:

   mkdir BAD826
   cd BAD826
   cvs -f checkout -r BAD826 -P atacs
   cd atacs/examples/
   make
   make channelTests

Also, I'm wondering which OS you're running on.  The nightly
regression and my reproduction were both on ming, which is:
  Red Hat Linux release 7.1 (Seawolf)
  Linux ming.ece.utah.edu 2.4.18-19.7.x #1 Thu Dec 12 09:00:42 EST 2002 i686
unknown
Sometimes strange bugs are only exposed when you move to a different
operating system.  (e.g., something wasn't initialized, or something
was address-dependent that really shouldn't have been, etc.)


As for jitterbug:

Our first messages about this bug, in which we wrote each other but
CCed atacs-bugs actually produced three separate bug reports.  The
problem is that the subjects didn't have the report number (The
"(PR#740)").  I was able to consolidate these into one bug report by
renaming the files behind jitterbug's back.  But it's probably still
best to use Compose Reply from the jitterbug web page, at least for
your first reply to the bug report.  Compose Reply inserts that
"(PR#740)" into the subject.
