This does work, so I'm closing it.

However, on the CADE lab, there still seems to be a problem running
GeneNet.  It is very strange.  Suggesting levels works, so calling
GeneNet seems to be okay.  Also, when I run the exact command from the
log window, GeneNet runs okay.  However, when I press the Learn button,
it seems to start because it creates one new file "contenders.txt", and
then GeneNet seems to hang.  The process is actually there, but it is
not making progress.  It is almost like GeneNet is suspended.

It is quite strange.  Do you have any ideas?  

Chris
