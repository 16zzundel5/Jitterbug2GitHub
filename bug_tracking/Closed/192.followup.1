Actually, I think it can also find an include file (at least one of the type
#include "file") if it is in the same directory as the file doing the
including.  For example, src/hse.cpp has 

#include "hse.hpp"

One level above, in the atacs directory, I can type

580 xia:~/atacs> g++ -DDDEBUG -DXIF -DMEMSTATS -DTIMER -D__LINUX
-I/usr/include/tcl -I/home/ming/software/include -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall
-g -c src/hse.cpp
581 xia:~/atacs> 

It compiles just fine, withOUT any -Isrc option.  Compare that behavior to the
what ATACS did in my original submission.
