This example now works.  It is a silly example which just tests the state
space exploration.  It should be composed of a number of self-loops.  The
options
needed are posets, subsets, and supersets to get it to complete in reasonable
time.
The example in ~atacs/examples/csp needs to be changed so that each process has
a unique name for it to work correctly.
