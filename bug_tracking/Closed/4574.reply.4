Still need to check the following:
1) Algebraic rule includes a relevant species.
2) Event trigger, delay, or assignment expression involves an assignment
to a relevant species.

An irrelevant species still needs to be removed from:
1) An algebraic rule which is composed of irrelevant species.
2) An event assignment to it.  The event should be removed if no assignments
remain after removing the one to the irrelevant species.
