I believe it will be a lot more user friendly if we have separate input places
for Boolean assignment (TRUE & FALSE or a choice table) and rate assignment (for
example, when Rate assignment check box is checked, the input row will be open
and allow user input) instead of having it all under Assignment lower bound.
