Local parameter names in reactions are mapped to new global names.  This
results in two new names for each local parameter because reactions are
parsed twice to allow reaction id's to be used in math.  

Likely this can be fixed by updating the reaction law manager at the
same time that reactions are parsed the first time.  This is likely okay
as the two pass was to deal with reaction ids being used in kinetic
laws, but this likely has other problems in this is dependent on the
order that reactions are parsed.
