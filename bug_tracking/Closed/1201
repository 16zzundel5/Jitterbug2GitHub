Dear friend,

I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment in London, England. I worked with British Railway Commission in Norwich for over a decade I married for fifteen years without a child. my wife died after a brief illness that lasted for two weeks.I vow to use my wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. Since the doctor had comfermed my situation that I will not live long I have decided to give out my money to the poor.

I deposited the sum of £18 Million (Eighteen Million Pounds sterling) in a Vault with a Bank .Presently, this money is still there. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 150 days due to cancer 
problem.Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an individual or better still a God fearing person who will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want an individual that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons, orphanages, and above all those affected in the Tsunami in far Asia and the Hurricane Katrina Disasters.

I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my relatives are not inclined to helping poor persons and I do not want my hard 
earned money to be misused or spent in the manner I will not like and I also do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Almighty.I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, and because of the presence of my relatives around me always. I do not want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank . I will also issue them a letter of authority and change of ownership certificate,that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this 
fund,through my Lawyer. I want you to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth.

Please always be prayerful all through your life.Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act according to my specification 
herein.

Hoping to hear from you. at my private email (bradon_franklin@mail8.com)

Thank you and may the Almighty bless you.

Yours sincerely,

Mr Bradon Franklin.
