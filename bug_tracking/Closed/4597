Chris,

I am currently walking my Bioinformatics students through your iBioSim  
tutorial and have a few suggestions.

Although we can 'parrot' or copy what you say and the pictures are  
nice, there is no real explanation as to the why we are doing it.  I  
think that if you were to start each step with a sentence explaining  
why we are doing the step that would be helpful.  For example,

instead of
3. Highlight the default compartment, select Edit Compartment, and  
change its ID to Cytoplasm. Also, change the units to volume

Perhaps,
3. As the reactions converting CI to CI dimer occur in the cytoplasm,  
the model should reflect this.  Highlight the default compartment,  
select Edit Compartment, and change its ID to Cytoplasm. Also, change  
the units to volume

The students kept asking me why we were doing things, and I had to  
guess why we were doing some of the steps....
