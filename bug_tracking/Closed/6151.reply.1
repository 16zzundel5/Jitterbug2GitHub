Hi Leandro,

I just checked the code for all uses of getExtension, and most of them do check
if the result is null.  However, 
there are many calls to getExtension in the hierarchical simulation code that do
not check if the result is null.  
This could potentially result in null pointer exceptions.  Therefore, I think
you need to make sure that they either 
check for a null result OR that you use getPlugin instead if you want to ensure
that you get something back.  
Could you please check into this?

Thanks,

Chris
