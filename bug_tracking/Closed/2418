Need to check that rule variable is compartment, species, and parameter.

Assignement and rate rules must not have a species variable that is 
created or destroyed in a reaction unless it is a boundary condition.

No more than one Assignment or Rate rule with the same variable.

Variable must not have assignment and initialAssignment on same variable.

No algebraic loops

Model must not be overdetermined.
