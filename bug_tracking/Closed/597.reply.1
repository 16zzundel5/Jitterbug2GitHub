This is a tricky one.  The problem is that when there are multiple files on
the command line, it first compiles each file individually except the top file.
It then processes the options compiles the top level file with the selected 
component.  

The assumption is that each of the lower level files should be loaded first 
followed by some processing specified by the options.  I'm not sure how to
handle
this.  Possible options are that options are all processed first but no
execution.
The problem with this is that if you have options nestled between execution then

what should be done?  Another option is to process all options up to the first
execution type command.  Any other ideas?
