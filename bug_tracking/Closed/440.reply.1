The problem is that without gatelevel switch all region functions are
implemented
at the same time.  Therefore, the same result comes for each excitation region
and
gets printed once for each excitation region.

Now, I have it so that it will only print for the first region when gatelevel is

not on.

Will check in tomorrow.
