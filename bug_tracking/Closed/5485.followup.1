Cool beans, but is there a reason why the outer species couldn't be automatically generated as in the case when there's a grid?

This is a bug, but if you want membrane diffusion to occur, you need to have the
species in the outer component/compartment as well as the inner compartment.  So
the membrane diffusion reaction shouldn't have been created, and I'll try to
figure out what happened.
