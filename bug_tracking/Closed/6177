When a species occurs multiple times in a list of reactants, products, or modifiers, it cannot be uniquely accessed.  Currently, you always get one particular speciesReference no matter which one you select.  Should match on more information to make a unique reference in the textual editor.  Not sure how to manage this in the schematic editor where you only know the species id.  I suppose could use position in the list and hook that on somehow.
