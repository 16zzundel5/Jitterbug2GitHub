It is a puzzling one.  I think the same thing has happened to me, but I also could not remember how that happened.  

By the way, I'm looking at the rule assignment issue.  I did indeed disallow assignment rules for Booleans.  I forget why though.  I think I can add support for that easily enough.  I assume we don't want them as variables in rate rules though as I cannot really figure out what that would mean.

Cheers,

Chris

A while after I submitted the bug I closed the project and reopened it, and when it reopened the boolean was still on the schematic; however, I was now able to delete it without problem.  I hope this helps.
