Subject: BUG: changing species name does not update component connections.

I suspect that this was a low visibility bug in the existing code, but it
becomes much more of a problem in the modelview.
The problem evidences itself when you change a species name that is
connected to a component. Save and re-open the gcm file and you'll notice
that the modelview tab is now broken and doesn't load at all.
