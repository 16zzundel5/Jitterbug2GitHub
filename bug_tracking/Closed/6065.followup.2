Good point.  Please make sure that you do not have any parameters with these id's in the model you are working with.  This is probably going to be problematic at the moment as you may not be able to use "i" and "j" in index math immediately.  We will need to address that.

Leandro: can you add a bug report about disallowing "i", "j", and any other ids we need for arrays to the variables that are disallowed?  I'm wondering though if maybe we want a more creative default id for arrays.

Scott: could you perhaps meet tomorrow afternoon at about 1:30 MST?  I would like Leandro to join the call.

Chris
