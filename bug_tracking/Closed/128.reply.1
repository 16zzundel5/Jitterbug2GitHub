You can now select the component using all three interfaces.
1) atacs
   atacs> doall <filename> <module>.<instance>
2) atacs -ya <filename> <module>.<instance>
   (note that this change makes in impossible for the *.csp to go through
multiple
    files like it used to).
3) xatacs atacs.tcl
   Enter the component into the component field in the file selection windows.
