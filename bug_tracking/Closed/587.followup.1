Indeed.  (It actually printed that error before, but it used to sail right past
it and attempt post processing).  The new version does seem correct.  The only
thing that puzzles me is that I thought you said this was the way to force
ATACS to post process examples that began as ER or TEL structures. 
Nevertheless, the particular problem I was reporting is no longer exercised by
this example.  Therefore, I will now close this bug report.
