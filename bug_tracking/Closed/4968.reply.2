Subject: Re: FEATURE: list all LPN parse errors in a window (PR#4968)
Date: Sat Jun 19 21:11:01 2010

When there is an error parsing expressions while loading an LHPN, a window pops
up at the end of parsing saying 
that there were invalid expressions in the file.  The actual errors are still
being outputted to the command line.
