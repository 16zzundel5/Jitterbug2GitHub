Subject: BUG: need to infer vacuous assignments when propagating
Date: Thu, 5 Nov 2009 11:07:41 -0700
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

Since vacuous assignments are explicitly put into the model, must  
infer that they are there when no assignment is present on a  
variable.  This way the value can propagate into it.
