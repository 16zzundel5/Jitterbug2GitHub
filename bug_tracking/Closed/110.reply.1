Subject: Re: compiler should set a flag when it sees a level (PR#110)

A flag is now set when a level is detected.  This eliminates the connectivity
check,
does not allow storeg to be used, and it also does not allow orbits to be used.
Please let me know any other features which you know of that crash on levels.
