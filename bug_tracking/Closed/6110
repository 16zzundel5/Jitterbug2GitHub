Sorry. I was unclear. When I was looking through all the windows I tried to open the modifier editor window from the schematic view. I created it and double clicked the new modifier to open the editor window. Instead of the window title being: "Modifier Editor" it was "Reactant Editor" and contained information that was previously attributed to the reactant.

So I think I was directed to the reactant editor rather than the modifier editor.

This has some interesting ramifications which I will soon likely email the arrays mailing list with.  For example, do we want to allow an initial assignment that does not assign every element of an array?
