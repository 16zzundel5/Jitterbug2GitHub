Subject: FEATURE: modify MPDE to return an actual sample path

"Mean-path" algorithm:

This algorithm returns the sample path that is *closest* to the  
average path. The advantage to this method is that it returns a bona  
fide sample-path. The returned path will generally be smoother than  
most randomly-simulated paths. The steps are:

(a) Initialize each interval with a state-vector X0, and set all the  
variances to zero.
(b) Run the gillespie algorithm N times, each run for a duration of  
tau seconds.
(c) Store the results in a table of state-vectors X_i, i=1,...,N.
(d) Compute the mean state-vector Xm.
(e) Compute the Euclidean distances d_i = |X_i - Xm|^2.
(f) Find the i for which d_i is minimum.
(g) Return X_i. This X_i is used as X0 for the next run.
