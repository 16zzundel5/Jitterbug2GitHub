Can you e-mail me your system example?  I don't have that problem when I
selected regA as interesting, and I wonder if we have slightly different
examples.  When I have a bit more time, I will look at some other cases and
see if I can figure out what's going on.  Removing uninteresting loops and
processes is definitely something that I think is worth looking into more.
 It seems that after removing variables, more of the graph can be removed
that is not caught with the current transforms.  Thanks.
