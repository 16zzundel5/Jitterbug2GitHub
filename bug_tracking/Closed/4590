Subject: FEATURE: add support for hierarchy in the GCM editor

Add tabs to GCM editor: Main Elements / Components

Components allow you to add/remove/edit components which have an ID,  
Component (i.e., gcm file in the project tree), and a port map from  
species in the component to species in the current GCM being edited.

Modify load / store gcm to include components and port maps.   
Components are nodes which have at a minimum the gcm file associated  
with the component.  Port maps are edges which go from instance name  
to species name and have at a minimum a port which is the species name  
in the component as well as arrowhead=none.

GCM to SBML needs to be modified to support components.  First, create  
an SBML from the GCM excluding the components.  Next, for each  
component instantiation, must create SBML for it, and rename species  
using port map, as well as all other IDs using the instance name.   
Finally, a compose function is needed to union all the SBML records  
for the top-level GCM and each component instantiation.
