origins or previous ownership history," she wrote.On Friday, The Washington 
Post reported that Fuqua's 84-year-old mother, who operated an art school 
for decades in Fairfax County under the name Marcia Fouquet, is an 
artist who specialized in reproducing paintings from Renoir and other masters. 
The Post said Fouquet had artistic links to Baltimore in the 1950s, 
when the painting was stolen, and graduated from Goucher College with a 
fine arts degree in 1952.A man who identified himself as Fuqua's brother, 
Owen M. Fuqua, told the Post that the painting had been in 
the family for 50 or 60 years and that "all I know 
is my sister didn't just go buy it at a flea market."The 
man later retracted his story, and ultimately said it was another person 
using his name who gave the initial interview.Efforts by the AP Friday 
to reach Martha and Owen Fuqua Friday were unsuccessful. Martha Fuqua's 
lawyer did not return a call Friday seeking comment.The FBI has an 
ongoing investigation, according to spokeswoman Lindsay Godwin.Meanwhile, 
U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ordered all parties seeking to claim 
ownership of the painting to make their case in written pleadings later 
this month.FILE - In this Sunday, March 31, 2013 photo, Pope Francis greets

File)The Associated PressNEW YORK  For decades, the Society of Jesus has 
faced the same struggles to find priests that have plagued the wider 
Roman Catholic Church. The Rev. Chuck Frederico, one of the priests who 
evaluate Jesuit applicants, says he usually heard from five a week, or 
fewer.Then, last month, the former Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio stepped out 
on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica   the first Jesuit 
to be elected pope.The number of queries jumped to four or five 
each day."Some guys who made contact in the past weeks are serious 
candidates," said Frederico, vocations director for the region from Maine 
to Georgia. "This election of the Holy Father has given them reason 
to examine this more fully."Jesuits have only started absorbing the novelty 
of one of their own leading the church. Most were so shocked, 
they Googled to confirm the connection before they dared to celebrate. Robert

Calif.  A federal judge on Friday rejected Gov. Jerry Brown's bid 
to regain state control of inmates' mental health care after 18 years 
of court oversight and billions of dollars spent to improve treatment.U.S. 
District Judge Lawrence Karlton in Sacramento ruled that the state failed 
to prove that it is providing the level of care required by 
the U.S. Constitution for the state's more than 32,000 mentally ill inmates."This 
court finds that ongoing constitutional violations remain in this action 
and the prospective relief ordered by this court remains necessary to remedy 
those violations," the judge said in his 68-page decision.The decision is 
a blow to the Democratic governor's attempts to end nearly two decades 
of expensive federal lawsuits that influence nearly every aspect of California's 
prison system. It also undermines Brown's efforts to lift a separate court 
order that otherwise will force the state to reduce its prison population 
by nearly 10,000 by year's end.Brown has promised to appeal."The state's 
lawyers are reviewing the order and we will send out reaction as 
soon as possible," Jeffrey Callison, spokesman for the Department of Corrections
