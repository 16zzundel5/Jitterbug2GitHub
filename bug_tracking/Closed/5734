I found a bug in that sbolField was not getting set when adding a new rule which caused an exception.  I moved the creation of this field outside the check for edit mode which removed the exception but SBOL cannot be associated still when adding a new rule.  It can only be done on edit.  Is this correct?  Shouldn't you be able to add it on creation of a rule?
