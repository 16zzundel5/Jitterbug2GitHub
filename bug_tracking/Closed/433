Says "how wonderful your book is!" won't help anything, right?

I will directly point out what I don't like and my opinion:

	1. I think you may try to extract out your example from the text,
	   and make it more like a "Problem with solution." Sometimes, it's
	   really hard for me to catch the information you want to explain
	   in a several paragraphs or even pages.

		Example 1: .............

			Solution:
				1. ......

				2. ......

	   In such style, for myself, it's more easy for me to read and
	   review the idea in the future as a reference book.

	2. The ultimate goal is knowing the algorithm and synthesis procedures
	   in the book, right? I think pseudo codes will be more helpful than
	   those math equations. I know some people like equations, but some
	   others like me are thinking in programming language way all the time.
	   Thus, a couple lines of pseudo code would be more understandable to
	   me.

	3. If possible, all the algorithm in the book should be implemented.
	   When the reader not able to attend your class, these programs
	   will help a lot for people who try to read your book for learning
	   what's Asynchronous synthesis about.

	4. Not every body is super smart, I am the one not in the smart group!
	   More examples and more steps to explain the idea you want to say
         would be very helpful. I really don't think that only smart person
	   can have the chance to learn asynchronous design. You might try
	   to scalar your book down to a certain level. Thus, your book will
	   be more readable to those non-asynchronous designers or undergraduate
	   students. Attracting more people involves in asynchronous world, which
	   is a very import goal for the book writer like you.


Overall, I like your book. It contains lots of information I used to look
for in
the very hard way. I am think to print a more mature copy of your book
before you
publish it (hopefully it still free them). Could you sent me notice when you
think
you are done with the final revise. Thanks.
