It would help to have the full path name given in the "Filename:" field of
the main window.  Similarly, it would help if the current directory path
were listed in the "fileselect" dialog box.  Speaking of that dialog box,
maybe the Ext->CSP filter should be the default if you arrive at the box
via File->Load->CSP (and similarly for each other format).  Also, it might
be nice to have a version of the File->Load commands that would
automatically do a Synthesize->Do All after loading the file.
