> STABLE RELEASE
>=20
> * Hierarchical Model Composition
>=20
>   - The first official version of the specification of Hierarchical
>     Model Composition is now available and thus the libSBML code for
>     'comp' is now included in the stable release of libSBML.  This
>     means that all prebuilt binaries for the stable release will
>     include the 'comp' package code. The src archive containing
>     libSBML core code will continue to be available but there will be
>     additional src archives available in the stable branch: one
>     containing libSBML core plus all stable packages and additional
>     archives of the individual package code.
>=20
>     NOTE: The libSBML GNU make-based build system has not been updated
>           for packages. Thus, to build from src, it is necessary to
>           use the CMake build system.
>=20
>     Known limitations of the 'comp' code:
>=20
>       + Documentation has not yet been integrated into the libsbml
>         documentation.
>=20
>       + Whilst the majority of validation rules have been implemented,
>         some will report the schema error id rather than the specific
>         comp validation rule id.  The more involved rules involving
>         circular dependencies and in-depth referencing have not been
>         implemented.  Validation of ModelDefinitions is implemented
>         with respect to comp validation, but not with respect to core
>         validation.
>=20
>       + There is no C API for interacting directly with comp
>         objects. However the C API for reading and validation will
>         apply to the 'comp' package and flattening can be accessed via
>         the converter C API to call the CompFlatteningConverter.
>=20
> * New features
>=20
>   - Convenience functions have been added to the SBMLExtensionRegistry
>     class to facilitate enabling/disabling packages using just the
>     package name. For example: disablePackage(const std::string&
>     package); enablePackage(const std::string& package);
>=20
>   - Previously the setNotes function accepting a string as argument
>     expected the string to contain the appropriate XHTML tags and
>     would not set the value of the <notes> element to a string that
>     did not meet this requirement.  The functionality of the
>     setNotes(const std::string&) function has been extended to allow a
>     user to add an optional boolean argument addXHTMLMarkup. When the
>     value of this argument is 'true' the function will accept a
>     string; wrap it with the XHTML <p> tag and set the <notes> element
>     to this.
>=20
>   - A C API for use with the converters has been added. Examples of
>     using the converter API are available in all supported languages.
>=20
>   - 'comp' package
>=20
>     - Access to the flattening routines has been restricted to the
>       CompFlatteningConverter.  This allows options to be specified by
>       the user regarding ignoring other packages and whether to
>       produce a document with no comp namespace or a document with the
>       comp namespace but the required attribute set to 'false'.
>=20
>     - Validation has been implemented (see note above). This is called
>       via the checkConsistency function within core libSBML; which now
>       accesses a checkConsistency function in the comp plugin.
>       There are two categories of validation:
>       LIBSBML_CAT_GENERAL_CONSISTENCY and=20
> LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY
>       which are enables or disable via the setConsistencyChecks()
>       function on the SBMLDocument (in libSBML core).
>=20
>     - The API for resolving external models has been updated to use a
>       registry of resolvers. This facilitates the addition of user
>       specific resolvers.
>=20
> * Bug fixes
>=20
>   - The number of arguments expected by a piecewise function
>     was incorrectly assumed to be two. However, a piecewise
>     function can have a single argument. This has been corrected.
>=20
>   - Validation of SBML Level 3 was issuing a general warning about
>     missing required attributes but failing to identify which
>     attribute had caused the error to be reported.  This has been
>     corrected. Thanks to Nicolas Rodriguez for pointing this out.
>=20
>   - Validation was failing to report the incorrect use of a function
>     call if the lambda function usesd expected no arguments. This
>     has been fixed.
>=20
>   - The L3Parser was not dealing with the sqrt function correctly.
>     This has been sorted.
>=20
>   - 'comp' package-specific bug fixes:
>=20
>     + SBOTerms were not being correctly dealt with when they
>       occured on a Port element. This has been corrected. Thanks
>       to Chris Myers for reporting this.
>=20
> * Configuration/build system changes
>=20
>   - Building the MATLAB binding for libSBML can be problematic due to
>     the need to identify and use the MATLAB mex compiler.  When MATLAB
>     is being accessed over a network this can result in misleading
>     error messages.  The build system has been improved to halt
>     compilation if the mex compiler is not available and to give a
>     clearer error message as to how to proceed.
>=20
>   - The build system has been updated to facilitate use with the
>     Mac OS X 10.8 operating system (Mountain Lion).
>=20
>   - 'comp' package-specific build system changes:
>=20
>     + The GNUMake build system has not been implemented for
>       packages. Thus, to build from src, it is necessary to use CMake.
>=20
> * Miscellaneous
>=20
>   - It was reported that gcc 4.7 found the various definitions of
>     isnan used within some parts of libSBML to be problematic.  This
>     problem has been addressed and there are now functions util_isNaN
>     and util_isFinite in the util file that are used throughout
>     libsbml.  Thanks to Totte Karlsson for reporting this.
>=20
>   - Where test files compare double values the comparisons have
>     been unified to use the util_isEqual(double, double) function
>     and thus avoid inaccurate results that can be machine dependent.
>=20
>   - This NEWS.txt file has reduced in size with NEWS dating from
>     prior to libSBML-5 now saved as an OLD_NEWS.txt file.
>=20
>=20
> EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE
>=20
> * New features
>=20
>   - 'Qual' package:
>=20
>     - The package specification redefined whether some attributes or
>       elements were required; the code has been updated appropriately.
>=20
>   - 'Fbc' package:
>=20
>     - The package specification added some optional attributes
>       and deprecated the use of strict less than or greater than;
>       the code has been updated appropriately.
>=20
> * Bug fixes
>=20
>   - 'Render' package:
>=20
>     - In some cases the code was failing to add expected attributes
>       to particular elements.  This has been corrected.

it is necessary to use CMake.<br><br>* Miscellaneous<br><br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;- It was reported that gcc 4.7 found the various definitions =
of<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;isnan used within some parts of libSBML =
to be problematic. &nbsp;This<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem has =
been addressed and there are now functions util_isNaN<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and util_isFinite in the util file that are used =
throughout<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;libsbml. &nbsp;Thanks to Totte =
Karlsson for reporting this.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- Where test files =
compare double values the comparisons have<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been unified to use the util_isEqual(double, =
double) function<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thus avoid inaccurate =
results that can be machine dependent.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- This =
NEWS.txt file has reduced in size with NEWS dating from<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prior to libSBML-5 now saved as an OLD_NEWS.txt =
file.<br><br><br>EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE<br><br>* New features<br><br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;- 'Qual' package:<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The =
package specification redefined whether some attributes or<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elements were required; the code has =
been updated appropriately.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- 'Fbc' package:<br><br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The package specification added some optional =
attributes<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and deprecated the =
use of strict less than or greater than;<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the code has been updated =
appropriately.<br><br>* Bug fixes<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;- 'Render' =
package:<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In some cases the code was =
failing to add expected attributes<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to particular elements. &nbsp;This =
has been =
corrected.<br><br><br>=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
