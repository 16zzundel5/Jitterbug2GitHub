At line 1556 in Run.java (gui/src/analysis/main), there is code that checks the exitValue from FBA.  Note the miscellaneous error -5 which prints that message.  In FluxBalanceAnalysis.java, there is a TODO which shows where the code that generates the exit codes exists.  The -5 is returned when the message does not match one we are aware of.  I was wanting you to determine if a message is still going to the console and then test for that message and send a new exit value which prints an appropriate message in Run.java.

This causes the program to say there was a problem and to "see console for details." My dilemma is that I don't know where the console message is coming from or how to intercept it so I can make it into an error message the user will see.
