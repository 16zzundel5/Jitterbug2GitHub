Subject: Re: BUG: orginal sets parameter to default value (PR#5059)

Seems to work now.  Interestingly enough, modifying a parameter's default in the
analysis view does change simulation behavior if that parameter was originally
set to default in the GCM.  Of course, there's no way of knowing whether the
original value was set to default without looking at the corresponding GCM, but
I guess it works.
