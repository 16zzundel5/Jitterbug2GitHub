As of cvs tag PR665reply2, I have fixed the way I generate the
most-concurrent starting point.  This fixes the deadlock in this
example.  However, this example still produces too many candidate
rules, and as a result, I generate file names that are too long.  This
prevents the example from completing.  I will need to do something
about that too...
