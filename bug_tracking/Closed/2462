Currently, rate rule updates of species is only performed after a
reaction event.  This is not technically correct as the rates may be
changing over time due to assignment rules and other rate rules.  This
also means that it is still illegal to simulate a model with 0 reactions
in a stochastic simulator.  One possible solution would be to have a
hybrid simulator that performs both differential equation simulation of
rate/assignment rules while also doing stochastic simulation for
reactions.
