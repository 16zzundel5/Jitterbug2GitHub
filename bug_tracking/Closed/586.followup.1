To get these to work I had to go back to ordering my sets of pointers
to events by the address of the pointer.  I believe this bug is in my
code.  The results I get seems to depend on the order of the
candidates going in.  This probably means my pruning techniques are
incorrect.

However, for now, I can simply avoid the problem by going back to the
old order.  And since it is the old order, it hasn't really
regressed.  So I'll call this bug fixed as of GOOD538.

I will now close this report.
