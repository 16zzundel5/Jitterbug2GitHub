Subject: BUG : iBioSim launch script no working
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,

I am trying to install iBioSim on the EBI machines and run into several 
problems.
I tried to go to the bug database 
(http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/cgi-bin/atacs) but I was
not able to fill in a bug there. (just found the mail to use at the end 
of the manual)

I have downloaded iBioSim 1.5 (Fedora 13 x64) 
(http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/iBioSim/iBioSim-1.5-Linux-x86_64-Install)

And the iBioSim script to start the program has a wrong CLASSPATH, has 
there was several libraries changed I have updated the script to
include all the libraries in the gui/lib folder :

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLASSPATH=$BIOSIM/gui/dist/classes

for jarFile in $BIOSIM_LIB_PATH/*.jar
do
    CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$jarFile
done

exec java -Xmx512M -classpath $CLASSPATH biomodelsim.BioSim

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like this, you don't need to worry about jar names changing, all of them 
are included.
I have removed libsbmlj64.jar and sbmlj.jar as there was already a 
libsbmlj.jar

If you do not modified the CLASSPATH, you cannot start the program as 
you get NoClassDefFoundException, the first one being :

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
org/jfree/chart/event/ChartProgressListener

Thanks,
Nico
