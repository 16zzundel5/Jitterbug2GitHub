Change the event editor to obtain the dimension from the ID field.

Change the event assignment editor to have a single combined index field.

For the event assignment editor, since it has no id, we will need instead a new dimension field for its dimensions.

Care must be taken that the dimension id's for event assignments are unique with respect to the dimension id's for the event, if they exist.
