Subject: BUG no port mapping for species in SBML associated with component

Submitted by: nroehner


I have species in an SBML file associated with a component and these species
share names with species that have been port mapped to/from the component.  When
I generate SBML from a GCM containing this component, the duplicate species in
the component's associated SBML file are not removed via port mapping.
