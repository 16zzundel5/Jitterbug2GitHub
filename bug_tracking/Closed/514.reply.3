It looks like the parser is not treating the constraint rule correctly in the
CSP file.  The constraint rule turns into this in the jordi2wc.er file:

# RULES:
# 
reset b-/1 0 0 inf

When it should be:

# RULES:
# 
b-/1 b-/1 [a]d 1 0 inf

Not sure why it only happens here.  Maybe it something to do with the fact that
this is a CSP file, and it should not have levels in it.
