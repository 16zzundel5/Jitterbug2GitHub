Actually, the command you used was wrong.  To show the net, you should do:

atacs -ysdn x

The sn command stores a file in .net format which is a format used by Peter
Beerel's
SYN tool, now defunct.  I have updated this also, so it no longer core dumps and
it
seems to output reasonable .net files, but I'm not sure that it is fully
functional.
Testing throughly is not too high a priority since this command is basically
not
useful anymore except as maybe template code for some other type of netlist
output
in the future.
