Subject: CHANGE: GCM to SBML to use reactant/product ids and globals
Date: Tue, 14 Sep 2010 11:16:56 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

SBML generated from GCMs could use reactant/product ids (or  
stoichiometry math for L2V4) as well as global variables to make them  
closer in form to GCMs and more easily modifiable during analysis.
