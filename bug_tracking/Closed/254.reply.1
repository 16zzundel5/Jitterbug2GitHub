findcover and resolve now output a file <filename>.cov when verbose is on which
prints out all minimal covers found for each excitation region before the
covering
problem is solved.  With "exact" on, the list will include potentially more
than
one per excitation region.  

Good examples to test this on are burst-mode ones, so ask hans.
