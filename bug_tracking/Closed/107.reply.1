In a case like this (this report relates to another (43)) consider
using Compose Reply instead of submitting a new report.  That way the
reply gets logged along with the original.  Also if the original
submitter replies to your reply, that will get logged as a followup,
and so on.  That keeps a record of the whole conversation in one
place.

Also, before moving a report to Needs testing or Closed, use Compose
Reply to send a message to the submitter explaining why you are moving
it there.

Thanks!
