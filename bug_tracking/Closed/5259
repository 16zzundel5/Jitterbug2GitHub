The problem was that it was never really considering the zero threshold.  S=
o if default was selected, it would catch an exception when it tried to get=
 the initial value from the species properties and set it to zero.  However=
, if an initial value was specified, it would start comparing it with the l=
owest nonzero threshold which would end up being the one it selects.
