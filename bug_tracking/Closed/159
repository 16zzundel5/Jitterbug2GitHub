Concurrent signal assignment (CSA) statements (both selected and conditional) 
are used to specify gates.  A CSA can be converted into a simple TEL structure
with an expression to set and another to reset the signal being assigned to.
Example:

x <= '1' when b = '1' and c = '1' 
     '0' when b = '0' and c = '0'
     x when others;

Should be a TEL structure: x- -[b & c] -> x+ - [~b & ~c] -> x-
