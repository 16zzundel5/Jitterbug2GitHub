When I edit an open model by adding a new species and draw an influence to a species that is created through complex formation, I get the error message "The merged SBML files have inconsistencies." if the model is also open in an analysis view.  I also get a pop-up box with the following message in it:

0:The value of a <speciesReference> 'species' attribute must be the identifier of an existing <species> in the model. 
Reference: L3V1 Section 4.11.3
 Species 'S3' is undefined.
