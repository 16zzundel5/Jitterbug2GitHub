Subject: Re: CHANGE: convert to level 2 version 4 (PR#4885)

I could not find a place in the code where an imported or created SBML file is
not converted to level 2 version 4.  However, I added a warning when this
conversion does not work correctly.  Send me a project where you have this
problem if it still persists.  Moving to needs testing.
