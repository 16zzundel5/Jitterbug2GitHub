Subject: BUG: VHDL compiler fails to compile slicing of std_logic_vector
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Refer to the example noc2by2_livelock_free.tar.gz.

The r_E_01.vhd module assigns "x" and "y" bit 1 and 0 of the
std_logic_vector "one_flit" signal respectively. The compiled LPN
generates transitions for this slicing, but fails to generates the
correct assignments. Also, "x" and "y" are not present in the final
LPN.
