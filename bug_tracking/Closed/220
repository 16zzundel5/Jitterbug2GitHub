ATACS seems to always regenerate the state space even if it already exists when

using the doall, resolve, and others synthesis commands to resynthesis circuits
Also noted that the resolve command does not seem to actually solve conflicts
in
cyclic tables.  To solve cycle tables ATACS seems to make you use the exception

option.
