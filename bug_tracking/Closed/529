My favorite example is a mesh-connected wormhole router for connecting
processors into a multiprocessor network. It's big enough to be
interesting, but still small enough to be understandable and tractable in
a small space. I can point you to a paper about it, but don't have the
time to do any actual writing for you about it. There's a paper in iccd
and also a section in my dissertation about it. I certainly don't mind if
you use it, as long as you credit it.
