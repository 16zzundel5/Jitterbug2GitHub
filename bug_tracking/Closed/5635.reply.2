It should no longer allow you to delete a model which is in use in another model
or within an analysis view.  You now must now delete these first.

Perhaps, there should be an option to automatically delete a file and all its
uses, but this solution is at least safe.  It had been the rule previously, but
it got broken when we moved from GCM to SBML.

Please test.
