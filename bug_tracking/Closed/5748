Need a new function that uses the continuous state information stored in the zone to determine the new state of the Boolean inequality variables and update them.  This should be called to compute the initial values of these variables.  This needs to also be called after a transition that has assigned any variables.  The interval expression evaluator will need to be used on the sub-trees that were identify at the start of analysis.
