Subject: FEATURE: deleting all runs in top-level simulation directory
Date: Tue, 22 Jul 2008 13:50:41 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.924)

In the graph editor, a right click on the analysis view name should  
provide the ability to delete all runs in the top-level of the  
analysis view.  Perhaps, there should also be a delete recursive which  
also deletes all simulation id directories as well.
