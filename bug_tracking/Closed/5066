This change report is from Nic (n.roehner@utah.edu):

Taking the bugs with biochemical and dimerization abstraction into consider=
ation, a general abstraction combining biochemicals and multimerization wou=
ld look something like

Karnap*RNAP*pow(Ka*Kb*Kd_A*Kd_B*pow(A, nd_A)*pow(B, nd_B)..., nc)*P.

Now that multimers are combining to form a biochemical species, the nd for =
each multimer species needs an identifying subscript.  I chose to move Ka i=
nto the pow expression since normally it is raised to nc without being expl=
icitly shown.  I've also included an equilbrium constant for the activated =
binding of RNAP, formerly bound up in Ka and incorrectly raised to nc.
