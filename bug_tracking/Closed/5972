ndamental rights of the people of Connecticut."The Connecticut 
Valley in Connecticut and western Massachusetts has been home to a large 
gun industry dating to the Revolutionary War.Andrew Doba, a spokesman for 
Malloy, said the governor is committed to job creation, but additional gun 
restrictions were paramount following the shooting deaths in December of 
20 children and six educators at an elementary school in Newtown."On this 
particular issue he's been clear: We need to prioritize public safety and 
this bill will improve public safety," he said.The law adds more than 
100 firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials 
have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry and eligibility 
rules for buying ammunition.Malkowski said he's received many emails from 
customers "fed up with Connecticut.""They urged us to pick up and leave," 
he said.Malkowski said he spoke Tuesday with Texas economic development 
officials trying to lure the company, which was founded in 2003 and 
employs more than 200 employees."It's something we'll strongly consider," 
he said, adding that leaving Connecticut would be difficult. "If you're 
a lawyer with a laptop, that's one thing," he said. "It's not 
something we're going to do easily."Jonathan Scalise, owner of Ammunition 
Storage Components, also of New Britain, said he's received offers from 
Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South 
Dakota andercent surveillance of the entire border, and apprehending 
90 percent of border crossers or would-be crossers -- or getting them 
to turn back to Mexico -- in sectors where the majority of 
unauthorized entries take place.As of the end of the 2010 fiscal year, 
the Department of Homeland Security reported achieving some level of operational 
control of 44 percent of the nearly 2,000-mile border, according to a 
Government Accountability Office report this year. Operational control was 
defined as the ability to detect and respond to cross-border illegal activity.In 
one border sector cited by GAO, the busy Tucson sector, 64 percent 
of people who managed to make it across the border were apprehended 
in 2011, while 23 percent turned back to Mexico and 13 percent 
got away. That meant the sector stopped or turned back 87 percent 
of crossers, close to the 90 percent level sought by the legislation.The 
new goals would be achieved by giving the Department of Homeland Security 
six months from the bill's enactment to create a new border security 
plan deploying the personnel, infrastructure and technology needed to achieve 
the 90 percent effectiveness rate. Also within six months, the department 
would have to create a plan to identify where new fencing is 
needed on the border. Once those plans are certified, people living here 
illegally could begin to apply for a provisional status allowing them to 
work here legally.If the 90 percent rate of apprehensioIn President Obama's push to crack down on the abundance of firearms 
in America, proposed gun-control legislation may be having the opposite 
effect.Updated FBI statistics show that background checks in the first three 
months of the year far outpace the number of checks in early 
2012. The stats show that from January through March, gun owners went 
through 7 million background checks -- compared with just 4.8 million in 
the first three months of last year.The spike in checks, coupled with 
mounting anecdotal claims that ammunition is hard to come by, comes amid 
concern by gun owners that new proposals at the state and federal 
level could limit access to firearms.Though supporters of the legislation 
say that is not the case, the assurances haven't stopped what statistics 
suggest is a run on weapons. The purchases have picked up ever 
since Obama's election in 2008. Since 2009, there have been 71 million 
background checks logged in the federal system. The annual number has risen 
every year.The recorded checks only apply to sales from licensed dealers.The 
most recent spike further adds to the underlying challenge facing lawmakers 
-- how do you regulate weapons when there are already 300 million 
of them, and rising, in circulation?While some lawmakers have proposed clawing 
back currently owned assault-style weapons, most proposed assault-weapons 
bans only apply to future purchases. And at the federal level, the 
chance of such a ban passing has
