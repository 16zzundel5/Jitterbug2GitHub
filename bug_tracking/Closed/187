When selecting context signals, it is possible that multiple ways exist to 
solve the covering table perhaps even with the same cost.  There are several
ways to break ties when two context signals are equally good:

1) Select the one providing symmetry with the reverse transition which should
   minimize wiring.
2) Select the one which does not remove quiescent states which should promote
   combinational optimization.
3) Select output over input which avoids using fedback state variables during
   burst mode synthesis to reduce the need for delay in the feedback path.
4) Finally, do not allow output signals to be used.  This does not produce a
   minimal result, but it forces the result to more closely match 3D for 
   burst-mode synthesis.
