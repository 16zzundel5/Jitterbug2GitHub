>=20
> * New features
>=20
>    - There was some disagreement about what libsbml when asked to =
write
>      out a required attribute in Level 3 where the value of the =
attribute
>      had not in fact been set. Following discussion within the libSBML
>      team and subsequently the libsbml-development mailing list it was
>      decided that the appropriate behaviour was to ignore the =
attribute
>      when writing out the model and thus not inadvertently give the
>      impression it has a value.
>=20
>    - Conversion from Level 3 to Level 2 involving variable =
stoichiometry
>      has now been implemented and this feature of L3 can now be =
converted
>      to L2.
>=20
>    - There is a getSupportedNamespaces function on the SBMLNamepaces
>      class which returns a List of the SBMLNamespaces supported by
>      this version of libSBML.
>=20
>    - Tracker issue #2082682
>      The unit checking of math involving the root function has been
>      fully addressed. Previously unit checking was only applied to
>      the expression root(n, x) if n was an integer. It can now handle
>      any value of n including an expression.
>=20
>    - Checking of the units of measurement in math expressions has been
>      further improved to provide checking to a deeper level with the
>      overall math of the model.  Thus, the units of the expression a^b
>      can now be validated even if the value of b is assigned b =3D c =
and
>      the model states elsewhere that c =3D 2.
>=20
>    - SBML Level 3 has no default attribute values and thus a number of
>      new isSetXYZ functions were introduced in libSBML-4.1.0.  Users
>      pointed out it was inconsistent that these functions returned
>      'false' for a Level 2 model in which the attribute concerned =
*did*
>      have a default value.  Thus, any newly introduced isSetXYZ
>      function that deals with an attribute that had a default value in
>      Level 2 will now return 'true' regardless of whatever the user =
has
>      explicitly set the function or not.
>=20
>    - The MATLAB and Octave bindings now include the function
>      OutputSBML() for writing the structure used in these environments
>      back to SBML.  This function has previously shipped as part of
>      SBMLToolbox.
>=20
>    - There is an additional constructor for an SBMLDocument object =
that
>      takes an instance of SBMLNamespaces as its argument.  This is =
similar
>      to the constructors for all SBML objects.
>=20
>    - There is now a custom manifest file included in the Java JAR =
file.
>      It contains the version number of the libSBML release.  An =
example
>      program demonstrating how to access the information is included
>      as the file examples/java/printLibSBMLVersion.java.
>=20
>    - An API manual for the C# language bindings is now available.  It
>      is not as complete as the C++ and Java versions, but it is quite
>      close.
>=20
>=20
> * Bug fixes
>=20
>    - The InternalConsistency validator was failing to report the =
absence
>      of required attributes or elements within an in-memory model.
>      This has been sorted out with a large number of tests added.
>=20
>    - Tracker issue #2960646
>      When writing out an SBML model containing the root function
>      Octave was failing to convert the formula into the appropriate
>      MathML.  This has been fixed.
>=20
>    - The code that checks for allowed functions in a Level 1
>      document was reporting an error if it encountered one of the
>      predefined functions.  This has been corrected.
>=20
>    - Checking for NULL references has been greatly improved
>      throughout.
>=20
>    - The appendNotes function was not correctly checking for the
>      xhtml namespaces declared at the top level.  This has been
>      fixed.
>=20
>    - In some cases the facility to create new 'Bags' within CVTerms
>      was not performing as expected.  This has been sorted out.
>=20
>    - Validation previously failed to report an error if a lambda
>      function contained only <bvar> arguments and no actual function
>      body.  This has been fixed.
>=20
>    - LibSBML checks that each element within a model being read has
>      the correct default namespace.  However, if the namespace had =
been
>      'declared' via a prefix this check was not being performed.
>      This has been corrected.
>=20
>    - A number of validation checks had an incorrect ErrorCategory
>      labels; thus, though these were reported by the correct part of
>      the libSBML validator, querying the category would produce an
>      inconsistent value.  These have been updated.
>=20
>    - There were some character encoding issues in a number of error
>      messages. These have been corrected.
>=20
>    - The documentation for a number of methods had fallen slightly out
>      of date with respect to the possible operation return codes they
>      could return.  We've updated those documentation strings now.  =
The
>      methods affected are in the classes Compartment, KineticLaw,
>      Model, Reaction, Rule, SBase, Species, Unit, UnitDefinition, and
>      XMLToken.
>=20
>    - The code that checked that the top-level elements of an =
annotation
>      had unique namespaces was incorrectly comparing prefixes rather
>      than actual XML namespaces.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to
>      Waclaw Kusnierczyk for reporting this and supplying the fix.
>=20
>    - The XML namespace for a <math> element may be declared on the
>      <sbml> element.  In this case, the XML namespace declaration must
>      use a prefix.  Code that checked that the MathML elements had a
>      declared namespace failed to check whether a prefix was correctly
>      used.  This is now fixed.  Thanks to the JSBML developers for
>      spotting this.
>=20
>    - The code that allows users to use LocalParameter and Parameter
>      interchangeably had a small bug where it failed to spot a
>      duplicate id for a Parameter but not a LocalParameter.  This has
>      been fixed.
>=20
>    - If a <kineticLaw> element is present, it must contain a <math>
>      element.  Prior to SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core, this has never
>      been explicitly stated as a validation rule but should have been
>      reported as a schema error.  In some case this was not happening.
>      This is now fixed.
>=20
>    - The printUnits.java example in examples/java incorrectly used
>      getId() on SBML objects that aren't defined to have id's in SBML.
>      Talk about setting a bad example!  Fixed.
>=20
>=20
> * Configuration/build system changes
>=20
>    - MATLAB 2010b introduced some inconsistencies in the build system
>      on certain platforms.  This has been fixed.  In addition, the
>      'configure' script for Linux and MacOS no longer attempts to
>      divine various properties of the MATLAB installation and run mex
>      itself, and instead, invokes MATLAB to compile TranslateSBML and
>      OutputSBML.  This should lead to fewer problems building the
>      bindings for MATLAB.
>=20
>    - Beginning with this release, LibSBML requires SWIG version 2.0.0
>      or higher.  This is to avoid a problem where the C# bindings will
>      not work with .NET 4 with SWIG versions prior to 2.0.0.
>=20
>=20
> * Miscellaneous changes
>=20
>    - We've updated the copyright statements.
>=20
>    - We've updated and fleshed out more of the API documentation.
>      Almost all object classes are now documented, especially for the
>      C++ and Java APIs.

<br><br>* New features<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There was some =
disagreement about what libsbml when asked to write<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out a required attribute in Level 3 where =
the value of the attribute<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had not in =
fact been set. Following discussion within the libSBML<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;team and subsequently the =
libsbml-development mailing list it was<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decided that the appropriate behaviour was =
to ignore the attribute<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when writing =
out the model and thus not inadvertently give the<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impression it has a value.<br><br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Conversion from Level 3 to Level 2 involving =
variable stoichiometry<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has now been =
implemented and this feature of L3 can now be converted<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to L2.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There =
is a getSupportedNamespaces function on the SBMLNamepaces<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class which returns a List of the =
SBMLNamespaces supported by<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this =
version of libSBML.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tracker issue =
#2082682<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit checking of math =
involving the root function has been<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fully addressed. Previously unit checking =
was only applied to<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the expression =
root(n, x) if n was an integer. It can now handle<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any value of n including an =
expression.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Checking of the units of =
measurement in math expressions has been<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further improved to provide checking to a =
deeper level with the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overall math of =
the model. &nbsp;Thus, the units of the expression a^b<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can now be validated even if the value of =
b is assigned b =3D c and<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the model =
states elsewhere that c =3D 2.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- SBML Level 3 =
has no default attribute values and thus a number of<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new isSetXYZ functions were introduced in =
libSBML-4.1.0. &nbsp;Users<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pointed out =
it was inconsistent that these functions returned<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'false' for a Level 2 model in which the =
attribute concerned *did*<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a =
default value. &nbsp;Thus, any newly introduced isSetXYZ<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function that deals with an attribute that =
had a default value in<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2 will =
now return 'true' regardless of whatever the user has<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explicitly set the function or =
not.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The MATLAB and Octave bindings now =
include the function<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OutputSBML() for =
writing the structure used in these environments<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back to SBML. &nbsp;This function has =
previously shipped as part of<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBMLToolbox.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- =
There is an additional constructor for an SBMLDocument object that<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;takes an instance of SBMLNamespaces as its =
argument. &nbsp;This is similar<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the =
constructors for all SBML objects.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There is =
now a custom manifest file included in the Java JAR file.<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It contains the version number of the =
libSBML release. &nbsp;An example<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;program demonstrating how to access the =
information is included<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the file =
examples/java/printLibSBMLVersion.java.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- An =
API manual for the C# language bindings is now available. &nbsp;It<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not as complete as the C++ and Java =
versions, but it is quite<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;close.<br><br><br>* Bug fixes<br><br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The InternalConsistency validator was failing to =
report the absence<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of required =
attributes or elements within an in-memory model.<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been sorted out with a large =
number of tests added.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tracker issue =

model containing the root function<br> =

cases the facility to create new 'Bags' within CVTerms<br> =

being performed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been =
corrected.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A number of validation checks had =
an incorrect ErrorCategory<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labels; =
thus, though these were reported by the correct part of<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the libSBML validator, querying the =
category would produce an<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inconsistent =
value. &nbsp;These have been updated.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There =
were some character encoding issues in a number of error<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;messages. These have been =
corrected.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The documentation for a number of =
methods had fallen slightly out<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of =
date with respect to the possible operation return codes they<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could return. &nbsp;We've updated those =
documentation strings now. &nbsp;The<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;methods affected are in the classes =
Compartment, KineticLaw,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Model, =
Reaction, Rule, SBase, Species, Unit, UnitDefinition, and<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XMLToken.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The =
code that checked that the top-level elements of an annotation<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had unique namespaces was incorrectly =
comparing prefixes rather<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than actual =
XML namespaces. &nbsp;This has been fixed. &nbsp;Thanks to<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waclaw Kusnierczyk for reporting this and =
supplying the fix.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The XML namespace for a =
&lt;math&gt; element may be declared on the<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;sbml&gt; element. &nbsp;In this case, =
the XML namespace declaration must<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use =
a prefix. &nbsp;Code that checked that the MathML elements had a<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declared namespace failed to check whether =
a prefix was correctly<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used. =
&nbsp;This is now fixed. &nbsp;Thanks to the JSBML developers for<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spotting this.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- =
The code that allows users to use LocalParameter and Parameter<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interchangeably had a small bug where it =
failed to spot a<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duplicate id for a =
Parameter but not a LocalParameter. &nbsp;This has<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been fixed.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If =
a &lt;kineticLaw&gt; element is present, it must contain a =
&lt;math&gt;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;element. &nbsp;Prior to =
SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core, this has never<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been explicitly stated as a validation =
rule but should have been<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reported as =
a schema error. &nbsp;In some case this was not happening.<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is now fixed.<br><br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The printUnits.java example in examples/java =
incorrectly used<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;getId() on SBML =
objects that aren't defined to have id's in SBML.<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk about setting a bad example! =
&nbsp;Fixed.<br><br><br>* Configuration/build system changes<br><br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- MATLAB 2010b introduced some inconsistencies in the =
build system<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on certain platforms. =
&nbsp;This has been fixed. &nbsp;In addition, the<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'configure' script for Linux and MacOS no =
longer attempts to<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divine various =
properties of the MATLAB installation and run mex<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself, and instead, invokes MATLAB to =
compile TranslateSBML and<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OutputSBML. =
&nbsp;This should lead to fewer problems building the<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bindings for MATLAB.<br><br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Beginning with this release, LibSBML requires SWIG =
version 2.0.0<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or higher. &nbsp;This is =
to avoid a problem where the C# bindings will<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not work with .NET 4 with SWIG versions =
prior to 2.0.0.<br><br><br>* Miscellaneous changes<br><br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We've updated the copyright statements.<br><br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We've updated and fleshed out more of the API =
documentation.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all object =
classes are now documented, especially for the<br> =
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C++ and Java =
APIs.<br><br><br>*********************************************************=
