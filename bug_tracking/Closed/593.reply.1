Should be fixed now.  To use it, you must do the following:

setenv ATACS <path to top of your atacs tree>
cd <path to top of atacs tree>/src
touch atacs.o
make
cd ../examples/<someplace fun>
Xatacs

Enjoy!

Note that only atacs -h commands are and will be supported from this
interface.  Now, I will go update all the help for just these commands.
