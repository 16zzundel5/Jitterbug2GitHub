No.   The dotty in my path was /home/ming/software/bin/shownet
which contains just 

dotty $1

That was the problem.  I created another shownet in /home/xia/peskin/customs/bin
(which appears on my path first) with the contents you suggest.  Now it works. 
Is there a better path from which to get shownet?

Please do not move reports like this directly into Closed.
Move them to Needs Testing.
If and when I (or the original submitter) confirms that the problem is resolved,
I will move them to Closed.

In this case, I will leave this report in Closed, because it works with the new
contents of shownet.
