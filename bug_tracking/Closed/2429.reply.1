The following issues remain:

Do we want algebraic rules at all?

Algebraic rules should be consistent under dimensional analysis.

variable for assignment and rate rules units
must be consistent between math and the variable.

assignmentRules and rateRules are not allowed on species used in
reactions unless the boundaryCondition variable is true.

Units of rate rule are those of the variable over time.

Model must not contain algebraic loops

Model must not be overdetermined by the algebraic equations
