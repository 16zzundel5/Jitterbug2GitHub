Hi Leandro,

I just noticed that when displaying dimensions, Scott used the function getIndexByArrayDimension to make sure he printed them in the right order.  However, for index, he uses getIndex which is not guaranteed to give them in the right order.  There does not appear to be a getIndexByArrayDimension function.  Could you add one, so I can fix this?

Thanks,

Chris
