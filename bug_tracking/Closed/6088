ever had. So amazing. I also tried a few slices of the Rosa pizza and that thing blew me away. The combination of onions, paremesan reggiano and arizona pistachios was a flavor I had never experienced. The pizza was rich and so ridiculously flavorful. It was one of the best specialty pizzas I have ever had. I came into Pizzeria Bianco with insanely high expectations and I believe the restaurant exceeded them. The ingredients are what really set this place apart from everyone else and the pizza is simply amazing. Bianco sets the standard for Neapolitan pizza in the United States and I am not sure there is another place that could beat it.... It took three tries to eat here. The first time we called (Sunday), it was closed. And according to their voicemail greeting, Pizzeria Bianco was booked for the next two months. The second time, we were told that there was a three hour wait, at which news we freaked out a little and ended up going to another restaurant. The third time, we showed up an hour before the restaurant opened so that we only had to wait TWO hours for a table. We were in Arizona, dammit, and by golly we were going to eat at this pizza place everyone kept recommending even if it killed us. Luckily, they strategically opened their bar next door at 4 p.m. so that we could drown our boredom in cider and Mexican Coke while we waited. Their hostesses were stunning and very sweet, and very skilled at keeping hungry people happy during a two-hour wait. We ended up ordering the Margherita, Rosa, Biancoverde, and Wiseguy pizzas. The Margherita and especially the Biancoverde were quite good and light. The Rosa and Wiseguy were very salty and oily. I wouldn't order them again. Still, the meal felt satisfying. Pizzeria Bianco reminds me very much of Basic in San Diego; both places have the floppy, slightly charred, thin-crust pizzas, the rugged brick walls, the wood burning oven. But Basic has no wait, better hours, a full bar, cheaper pizza pies, and more toppings to choose from. So is Pizzeria Bianco worth the wait? Sure, but more so you can say you experienced a Phoenix institution than for the food. 3.5 stars. My mother and several of her friends would always rave about this place. For years, I just never bothered going here because I just don't like the downtown Phoenix area. A few months ago, though, I finally decided to give it a try. Some family members and I met up downtown and were ready to be blown away by some
