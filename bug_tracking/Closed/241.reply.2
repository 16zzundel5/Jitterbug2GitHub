This seems to be fixed now:

546 xia:/tmp> diff /home/ming/stjung/atacs/examples/bm/ cdp.g
547 xia:/tmp> atacs -lg cdp.g
ATACS VERSION 4.1
Logging session in:  atacs.log
Converting Petri net to ER and storing to:  cdp.er
548 xia:/tmp> 

I will close this report now.

However, see my new bug report 252.
