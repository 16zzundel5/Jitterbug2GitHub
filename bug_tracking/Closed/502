I checked in three files to examples/vhd:
mult_ctrl_done.vhd
mult_ctrl_done_env.vhd
mult_ctrl_done_top.vhd

I wanted delays from 0 to inf for atacs.  So for simulation I had to declare a
constant inf : integer := 234234234; -- really big

The atacs compiler says this is a syntax error.  It should just be ignored by
atacs.
