Subject: BUG: reaction/modification edges don't get added to the gcm

If I look at gcm.getInfluences() there aren't any reaction or modification
edges.  I think this should be happening somewhere in
tryAddAssociationBetweenCells() within Schematic.java.  There's an
occurrence of gcm.getInfluences().put(name, newInfluenceProperties) in an
else statement that is rarely executed.  I tried putting that line in other
places but ran into some errors elsewhere.
