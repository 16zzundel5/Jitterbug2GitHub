It should be possible to set the file stem to use during simulations.
For ODE simulation, the default should be ode which has "-run" added to
it.  Random ODE simulations may have "-run-#" added to it.  For Monte
Carlo, the default should be empty with "run-#" added to it.  

A directory should be created for each <stem>-run-# which includes the
runs, average, variance, and standard deviation.
