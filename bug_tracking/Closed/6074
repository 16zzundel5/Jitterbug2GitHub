Subject: CHANGE: Disable Contains Undeclared Units Warning window in LEMA's
 schematic editor
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

After an LPN transition is edited, there are three consecutive warning
windows about undeclared units on event assignment to variables,
preset and postset places, and delay. It wold be nice if these checks
are disabled for LPNs, at least temporarily. Otherwise, whenever a
single transition is edited, one has to click the "OK" buttons several
times to go through these warnings, which do not have significant
meanings for an LPN.
