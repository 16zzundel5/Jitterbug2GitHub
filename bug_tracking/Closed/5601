Allow any SBML object to be annotated with a list of URIs for SBOL DNA components.

This includes devising a proper way to annotate the components, as well as, an interface for entering the lists.

Each SBML editor window would have a "Associate SBOL".  This would bring up the current ordered list of associated DNA components for this SBML object.  This list would show the displayIds for these objects.  This window would have an "Add", "Edit", and "Remove" buttons.  The Add and Edit buttons would open an SBOL browser to allow the selection of a DNA component.  This browser is similar to the one before except with an option to filter the list by SO type.
