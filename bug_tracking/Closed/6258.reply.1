There are two possible sources of this error:

1) You have some reaction without a flux bound defined.  The latest version that
I posted about 24 hours 
ago will give you this error message rather than the exception.

2) You added reactions with flux bounds then deleted them.  There is a bug which
Adrian discovered 
yesterday in which deleting a reaction does not delete its flux bound.  If you
have this problem, you can 
either edit the XML file to remove the extra flux bounds or send it to me to do
so.  This bug will be fixed in 
2.8.4.
