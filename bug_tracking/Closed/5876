> Now that I have diffusion mostly figured out, I started working on =
dynamic events for movement and symmetric division, and I found several =
bugs.  For these events I believe you said they will only work with the =
java simulators, so I have been sticking to rkf45(java) and =
SSA-Direct(java).
>=20
> To begin with, I made a single cell that does nothing but Move Random. =
 I first simulated this with rkf45(java) and it ran into an error, a =
Null Pointer Exception.  Oddly enough, when I switch simulators to =
SSA-Direct (java), the simulation just smoothly and I can see the cell =
move around.  However, when I tried to simulate exactly the same sort of =
movement, but in a more complicated model that also includes diffusible =
species and cells with multiple compartments I run into the Null Pointer =
Exception error again, even when using SSA-Direct (java).  I am not sure =
why it worked for the simple model but not for the more complicated one. =
 I have submitted bug reports for both the simple rkf45(java) and more =
complicated SSA-Direct(java) errors.
>=20
> I also tried to simulate Symmetric Cell Division.  Again I started =
with a very simple model, a single cell in the middle of a grid, with =
only 1 event, Symmetric Division, there was nothing else in the model.  =
This ran into the Null Pointer Exception with both rkf45(java) and =
SSA-Direct(java).  I also submitted a bug report for this one.
>=20
> Let me know what you think about these bugs, I know you were working =
on dynamic events earlier this semester so maybe this is another case =
where it works on your computer but not on mine.  Also, I think it might =
be the case that all 3 of the bugs I submitted reports for are actually =
the same bug, I am not sure so I figured I would give you extra =
information just in case.  Also, I know that you are busy, so no rush, =
you can get around to this whenever you have time.  And I know that you =
have said this section of code is not as robust as the others, so if it =
turns out that we cannot get dynamic events to work, I can probably come =
up with a backup plan that still models multiple cell types and =
diffusible species and host response without the use of dynamic events.
