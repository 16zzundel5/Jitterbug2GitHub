Could you send me a tsd file that has small values in it so I can figure out if
I can make the grapher graph them?  Also, I forgot to mention it earlier today,
but the full backups aren't burning to dvds.  I still get emails that the dvd
needs to be changed, but only the incremental backups are burning.
