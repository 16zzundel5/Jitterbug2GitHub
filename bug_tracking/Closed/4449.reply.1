Subject: Re: BUG: Extra timepoint occurs in tsd file (PR#4449)
Date: Tue May  6 19:33:53 2008

Found the problem, it's not an extra data point, rather there's this line in the
tsd file:

(13800,0,114(0,0,0,253,214,220)

I am not sure how this error occurred, and I am trying to reproduce it, but it
might be a one time thing.
