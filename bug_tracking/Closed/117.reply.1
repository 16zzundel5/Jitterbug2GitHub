I have fixed the font to be a mono-spaced font.

As for the window size, my inclination is to leave it as is.  Practical designs
will produce windows that quickly overfill the screen which I think is pretty
annoying to the user.

Example is parg versus dot.  Parg will display a graph using as much screen as
it needs.  Dot will always open a window of the same size.  I believe the later
is more palatable.
