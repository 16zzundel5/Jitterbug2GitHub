ndamental rights of the people of Connecticut."The Connecticut 
Valley in Connecticut and western Massachusetts has been home to a large 
gun industry dating to the Revolutionary War.Andrew Doba, a spokesman for 
Malloy, said the governor is committed to job creation, but additional gun 
restrictions were paramount following the shooting deaths in December of 
20 children and six educators at an elementary school in Newtown."On this 
particular issue he's been clear: We need to prioritize public safety and 
this bill will improve public safety," he said.The law adds more than 
100 firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials 
have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry and eligibility 
rules for buying ammunition.Malkowski said he's received many emails from 
customers "fed up with Connecticut.""They urged us to pick up and leave," 
he said.Malkowski said he spoke Tuesday with Texas economic development 
officials trying to lure the company, which was founded in 2003 and 
employs more than 200 employees."It's something we'll strongly consider," 
he said, adding that leaving Connecticut would be difficult. "If you're 
a lawyer with a laptop, that's one thing," he said. "It's not 
something we're going to do easily."Jonathan Scalise, owner of Ammunition 
Storage Components, also of New Britain, said he's received offers from 
Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South 
Dakota andns isn't achieved 
in high-risk border sectors within five years, a commission made of border 
state officials would make recommendations on how to achieve it.After 10 
years, people granted "registered provisional immigrant status" could apply 
for green cards granting them permanent residency -- and the ability to 
seek citizenship -- if the new security and fencing plans have been 
completed, the mandatory employment verification system is in place and 
used by all employers, and the new electronic exit system is operating 
at airports and seaports, collecting machine-readable visa or passport information 
from airplanes and ships.The electronic exit system is meant to keep better 
track of people in the country on temporary visas. Some 40 percent 
of people in the country illegally arrived with visas but stayed after 
they expired. The employment verification piece would be an expansion of 
an existing system called E-Verify that's currently voluntary for most employers, 
though it's mandatory in some states.The bill would allocate $5.5 billion 
for the various proposals, including $1.5 billion for fencing, $2 billion 
for other border measures and $2 billion to help the commission of 
border state officials do its work, should that become necessary, the person 
said, stressing more or less money could be allocated if needed.The border 
security details were first reported Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal.ad aloud the lyrics to Carney. Jay-Z and Beyonce are both 
Obama supporters."It's a song," Carney said. "The president's not communicating 
with Jay-Z over this trip."Several Florida lawmakers had lashed out at the 
couple, and the administration, over the trip. U.S. law bans tourism by 
Americans to Cuba, though there are exceptions for certain cultural trips.Sen. 
Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a statement earlier this week: "U.S. law 
clearly bans tourism to Cuba by American citizens because it provides money 
to a cruel, repressive and murderous regime. Since their inception, the 
Obama Administration's 'people to people' cultural exchange programs have 
been abused by tourists who have no interest in the Cuban people's 
freedom and either don't realize or don't care that they're essentially 
funding the regime's systematic trampling of people's human rights."The 
Treasury Department clarified in a letter earlier this week that the couple 
traveled to Cuba under an "education exchange trip" organized by another 
group. The department said it handles authorizing these trips.
