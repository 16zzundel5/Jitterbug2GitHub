In the schematic editor, I am unable to draw arcs from species to components and
vice versa.  The only way I can map species to ports is to double click on the
component and edit the port map that way.  However, Hiro is running 64-bit
Ubuntu and is unable to edit the port map even when double clicking on the
component to edit it.
