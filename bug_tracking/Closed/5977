Don't fall victim to your social network with these simple tips.Spencer 
E. HoltawayIf you're like most people, you visit Facebook a few times 
a day. You catch up on the latest gossip, "Like" cute baby 
or pet pictures, and maybe post something yourself. Facebook makes these 
things simple.Facebook is so simple, in fact, that you might not know 
you're using it wrong. Here are 3 things you really need to 
stop doing on Facebook.1. Confuse public and private conversationsThere 
are a few ways to communicate on Facebook. One is to post 
a message on your Timeline for everyone to see.Another is to post 
a message directly to a friend's Timeline. These are the posts that 
show up in your Timeline labeled "Jane Doe > John Doe."Far too 
many people think the second method is a private conversation. That isn't 
the case. Think of it like a public speaker on stage talking 
to one audience member instead of the entire audience. Everyone can still 
hear everything they're saying.I've seen people who don't know this ask 
friends very personal questions. It can be embarrassing for everyone.To 
send a private message, click the Messages link to the left of 
your news feed. Then click the New Message button.You can also go 
to your friend's profile page and click the Message button near the 
top right of the page. Or, just pick up a phone.2. OvershareSocial 
media sites like Facebook encourage you to post your thoughts, experiences, 
pictures, videos and whatever else
AMMAN, Jordan  The leader of an al-Qaida linked militia fighting to 
overthrow the Syrian government has vowed to take revenge for what he 
says was Damascus' use of chemical weapons that killed hundreds of people.Jabhat 
al-Nusra leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani's comments came in an audio recording 
posted Sunday on a militant website that usually carries al-Qaida and similar 
groups' statements. It also appeared on the group's Twitter and Facebook 
accounts.The authenticity of the claim could not be immediately verified.Al-Golani 
said he plans to target Shiite Muslim villages. President Bashar Assad's 
regime is dominated by the Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.Last 
Wednesday's alleged chemical attack in a suburb of Damascus prompted U.S. 
naval forces to move closer to Syria as President Barack Obama considers 
a military response.
ic and social challenges. Bo's downfall 
also has been widely perceived as the result of his defeat in 
party infighting ahead of China's once-a-decade leadership transition last 
fall.In a rare show of openness, the court has been publicizing details 
of the trial in a bid to lend credibility to what is 
widely seen as a political show trial. Bo, in return, has refrained 
from using the trial as a stage on which to denounce the 
administration and the opponents who purged him   which would likely 
be the leadership's worst nightmare."So far, the worst has been avoided," 
said Ding Xueliang, a Chinese politics expert at Hong Kong University of 
Science and Technology. "He's been trying to play the game within the 
limitations set up by the Chinese leadership. He does not talk about 
politically sensitive things, even though everybody inside and outside China 
knows that he's in trouble for politics."Still, the ousted leader mounted 
an unexpectedly spirited defense against charges of abuse of power and of 
netting $4.3 million through corruption, recanting earlier confessions and 
rarely expressing contrition as he sought to lay the blame for most 
of the misdeeds on his wife and others. He deftly cross-examined witnesses, 
and was selectively unable to recall key details when the questioning turned 
to him.It appeared to be Bo's last-ditch effort to repair the damage 
the scandal wrought on the clean, populist image he had so carefully 
cultivated for ye
