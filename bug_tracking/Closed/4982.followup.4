Hi Kevin,

My bad.  I was confused about which transform is which.  They are both  
working, I think.  However, the simplification is a bit tricky to  
parse.  It is pretty complex when there is more than two transitions  
being combined which is caused by combining two at a time.  It would  
be good for the simplification to combine all transitions  
simultaneously.

Another issue is that in the example I sent, the fail transitions do  
not combine because they have no postset.  It should be safe to  
combine transitions that have identical postsets including this  
possibility of there being no postset for all the transitions.

Finally, uniform delays with equal bounds as in this case should not  
need to use uniform delays.

Hmm, I just thought of one potential problem which is that the  
expressions need to be disjoint.  I'm not sure how to check this.  In  
this case, it is obvious.  However, in general, it may be tricky to  
determine.

Chris
