parseFormula does not make t be the time variable.  This works fine for
our simulator, but it may cause problems with others using the sbml that
we generate.  To fix, need to do something like:

ASTNode *node = SBML_parseFormula("t")
node->setType(AST_NAME_TIME)

However, this requires finding the "t" variable in the ASTNode tree from
the formula.
