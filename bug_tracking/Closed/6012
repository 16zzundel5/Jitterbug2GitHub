LOS ANGELES  Theres low, and then theres low.Former MTV reality star 
Farrah Abraham, 21, who shot to fame as a subject of the 
networks 16 and Pregnant in 2009 and its spinoff Teen Mom, admitted 
this week that she had sex on camera with professional porn star 
James Deen. It was then widely assumed the idea was that the 
video was to then be leaked as a celebrity sex tape.While sex 
tapes are nothing new in the scandal drenched Hollywood community, some 
argue that hiring a "pro" to orchestrate a fake sex tape is 
evidence of a whole new level of desperation.Staging an event like this 
is really a desperate cry for fame. As the old adage goes, 
fame is fleeting and only lasts fifteen minutes. But todays stars, and 
reality stars in particular, are looking for ways to make their fame 
last as long as possible," sociologist popular culture expert Dr. Hilary 
Levey Friedman told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. "The way to keep building 
fame is to be talked about, and in our crowded media space 
it takes something quite controversial to get so much ink."Life and career 
strategist Suzannah Galland says Abrahams stunt says a lot about our culture.Hollywoods 
impact has misguided youth yet again. This is a new low of 
lows where the latest self-creative hype is shaped around being crude and 
in your face, she said. Its very clear that being an exhibitionist 
is in demand, and will encourage other aspiring fame seekers to crave 
the same kind of attention.Even thouhad a few more advantages -- involved adults, good 
schools, a supportive community and a safe neighborhood."That was the difference 
between growing up and becoming a lawyer, a mother and first lady 
of the United States and being shot dead at the age of 
15," Mrs. Obama said, her voice gripped with emotion.The speech was Mrs. 
Obama's first public remarks on gun violence since the Sandy Hook shooting 
in December took the lives of 20 students and six faculty and 
reignited a national debate over gun control. But with the fate of 
the administration's efforts still uncertain, the White House was mounting 
an all-hands-on-deck push to keep the public engaged.The president delivered 
a speech Monday in Connecticut, and 12 family members of Sandy Hook 
victims joined him on the return flight to Washington and have since 
been lobbying members of Congress. Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney 
General Eric Holder promoted the plan Tuesday at the White House, and 
Biden was set to make the case again Thursday on MSNBC's "Morning 
Joe."The Senate was planning an initial vote Thursday to begin debating 
gun legislation, with some Republicans attempting to block consideration 
of the measure. Two pivotal senators announced a bipartisan deal Wednesday 
to expand background checks to more gun sales, which could build support 
for President Barack Obama's drive to tighten firearms laws. But the ultimate 
fate of the legislation remains unclear with strong oppositioApril 10, 2013: A rack of AR-15 rifles stand to be individually 
packaged as workers move a pallet of rifles for shipment at the 
Stag Arms company in New Britain, Conn.APNEW BRITAIN, Conn.  A Connecticut 
gun-maker announced on Wednesday it intends to leave the state, just six 
days after passage of restrictive gun control legislation, while two other 
manufacturers said they are considering relocation offers from other states.Manufacturers 
also plan to lobby the state's congressional delegation next week "to make 
sure they hear from our side," said Mark Malkowski, president of Stag 
Arms in New Britain.Bristol-based PTR said in a statement posted on its 
website that it has not decided where it will move, but has 
commitments from most employees to relocate. The company makes military-style 
rifles and employs more than 40 people. PTR Vice President John McNamara 
said the company expects to make a more formal announcement about a 
move within six weeks."Along with other companies in the trade, we were 
deeply apprehensive at the hurried process to develop new gun laws and 
fearful that it would generate unintended consequences for our industry," 
the company said.With the legislation signed into law by Gov. Dannel P. 
Malloy on April 4, "our worst fears were confirmed," the company said. 
"What emerged was a bill fraught with ambiguous definitions, insufficient 
considerations for the trade, conflicting mandates and disastrous consequences 
for the fu
