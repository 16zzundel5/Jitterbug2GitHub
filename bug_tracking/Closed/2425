There should be no default for size.

No size should be allowed for 0-dim compartment, and constant should be
true.

Units of size must be:
dim
3    volume (litres, cubic metres, or derivatives) or dimensionless
2    area (square metres or derivatives) or dimensionless
1    length (metres ore derivatives) or dimensionless
0    none

0-dim compartments should not appear in mathematical formulas.

If constant is true, size can only be changed by initialAssignments.

0-dim compartments cannot be outside of any compartment except other
0-dim compartments.

Directed graph implied by outside construct must be acyclic so that no
compartment contains itself.
