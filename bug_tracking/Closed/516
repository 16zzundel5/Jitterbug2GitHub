Eric,

It did it a gain!  And you are not here to see it. Here is the message:

Checking status of tree rooted at /home/shang/eemercer/research/atacs/
WARNING M examples/hse/pchb.hse: You have modified this file but not
committed it.
WARNING U src/hse.cpp: Another user has modified this file.
WARNING ? src/trace.vhd: You have not cvs added this file.
Committing just ... could break the repository!
Are you sure you want to proceed (yes/no)?  


Here are the files modified in my directory:

findrsg.c (I was checking this in)
bag.cc
bag.h

examples/hse/pchb.hse

I did not run the regression first before trying to check in findrsg.c.
Maybe this has something to with the results.
