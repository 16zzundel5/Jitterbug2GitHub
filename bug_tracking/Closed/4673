When we add new variables, a couple interesting discovery.

In general, should we allow any two variables with same variable name?

For Boolean type, LEMA does not check for variable name. eg. you can add as many
Boolean variable "x" as you want.

For Continuous type, LEMA will check if variable with same name, same type
exists. eg. you can have Boolean variable "x" and Continuous variable "x." But
will display error message if you try to create 2 Continuous "x" variables.

For Integer type, LEMA checks for all type/all name. Integer displays an error
message if there is any variable (any type) with the same variable name.
