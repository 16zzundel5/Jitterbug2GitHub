Subject: FEATURE: add field to component to indicate that it is in a new compartment
Date: Mon, 6 Dec 2010 11:38:23 -0700
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

During GCM to SBML translation, each component that is assigned to a  
new compartment would have its species and reactions assigned to this  
new compartment.

RNAP would be given a name that includes the compartment name.

After flattening, you need a list of compartments.

Compartments should have a size field that is saved on flattening as  
well.

Initial RNAP amount should be stored with the compartment.

Species should use the RNAP that has the maximum compartment name that  
matches the prefix of the species name.
