tomatoes.  The cheese and remaining ingredients are every bit as fresh and complimentary to the balanced flavors.  Bianco is the perfect special occasion pizza. Echoing a lot of other reviews - it's definitely a bit overrated and the wait can be insane (even with a reservation; I can't imagine trying without one).. but it's still a fun and memorable experience with pretty good pizza and wine. If you go, I definitely recommend going with a group of ~8-10 people and making a reservation well in advance (I've never been for lunch but I've heard that it's more feasible for that). There's a nice beer and wine bar next door (which, I assume, strategically at least doesn't mind that people are waiting a long time to be seated). As long as you go with a good group of people and consider the waiting to be part of the experience, I don't think you'll be disappointed. The biggest shame for me is that they don't have patio seating (in Phoenix it's nice enough for that almost year round). That said - it's a beautiful and central location, and if you go when it's a bit chilly out (by Phoenix standards), you probably won't mind eating inside. I can't bring myself to give it an overwhelmingly positive review (mainly because they're so overrated) but I can say that other than the waiting (which is part of the experience if you're with the right people and not in a rush), I've never been disappointed or had a bad time there. Definitely recommend trying it out at least once. Came for a late lunch, early dinner on a Saturday after the car show at the convention center. It was busy down town, so even at 230/3, we hade a 40 minute wait or so. We started at bar bianco next door with a few drinks and appetizers. I had the hard apple cider -really good and we shared the cheese plate and the ricotta crepes. Yum! The Bianco Dinapoli tomato sauce with the crepes was really good, we dipped our bread/crackers in it. Once our table was ready they called us over to the restaurant. We had a table for 2 inside, it's a bit small inside, making it pretty cosy. We ordered just the Rosa pizza, the one with pistachios. It was really good. Good medium size ish pizza with great flavor. Good for 2 to share. While I did like the bar, the appetizers, pizza, and the location...I'm just not sure I want to wait 40 mins to 2 hours to get in every time. Maybe the best meal I have ever had- and I truly mean this. I thought the hyperbole about this place seemed lofty but the end
