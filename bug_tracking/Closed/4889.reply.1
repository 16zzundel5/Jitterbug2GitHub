Perhaps, the learn tab should list all variables in the data and have a checkbox
to select which variables to use when learning.  Also, include a checkbox at the
top to select all.  The selected variables should default to those in the LHPN
from which the learn view is built.  However, the selected variables should be
stored as a property with the learn view.  Therefore, one can simply start with
a blank LHPN and add all variables with one mouse click.  

The list of variables should likely be restricted to only those variables that
appear in all the data files.  If instead, we use the union of variables, we
have problems figuring out how to interpret missing data.

Perhaps, the data manager and grapher could still show all the variables which
would simplify their interface.

Note that when creating a data file manually (typically just in iBioSim), you
would need a list of variables for the file which would presumably still come
from the GCM/LHPN file.
