Subject: Re: CHANGE: .sim and .lrn not needed anymore (PR#2387)
Date: Mon Jul 28 22:58:02 2008

Now, the .sim and .lrn files are removed from views, the <filename>.pms file is
renamed to <filename>.sim, and the <filename>.sim and <filename>.lrn files are
used to determine whether the directory is a learn view or an analysis view. 
Moving to needs testing.
