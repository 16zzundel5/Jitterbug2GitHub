Create a new model, add a place, add a failure transition with zero delay a=
nd enabling condition 'true', and save. When you create a verification view=
, you get the error:

 "The following items cannot be converted to an LPN: Constraint: G(true, !(=
fail =3D=3D 1))"

Click 'OK' and select view. After clicking on 'Run' you get the same error =
and the failure transition is not red, indicating that it is not a failure =
transition. This can also be verified by exporting the model as an LPN and =
checking the transition.
