Please change the message instead of

"for the <field name>"

to 

"for the <field name> index"

Also, this message is only occurring for species.  However, in other cases it is also unclear as messages like extra brackets could be for index or dimension.  Instead of messages that start "String ... " change to "Index ... " to make this more clear.
