Refer to the verification view (producer_consumer_NEW_verif) in
nondeterm.tar.gz.

Untimed state exploration (search_dfs in Analysis.java) without POR on
producer_consumer_NEW.xml produces the following disabling error:
Disabling Error: producer_to_buff1_sendM2(producer_consumer_NEW) is
disabled by producer_to_buff1_rcvM1(producer_consumer_NEW).

Both transitions are persistent, so this error should not occur. As a
comparison, the same analysis (see the "test" verification view) on
producer_consumer_NEW.lpn does not encounter this error. The XML file
was generated from the LPN by "Save As".
