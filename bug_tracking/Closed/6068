For all objects with dimensions, we will use the ID field to enter the dimension as follows:

<ID>[<parameter>][<parameter>] etc.

This means the brackets will need to be stripped off to extract the identifier.  Any place in the editor that expects an id, should use this.  For each bracketed parameter, a dimension will be added to the list of dimensions with the first being dimension 0, next dimension 1, etc.  Should be able to use a split on "[" perhaps while removing the last bracket.  Use a loop to set the dimensions.  You do not need to worry about the number of dimensions specified, we can allow it to be any number safely.

The parameter used to specify the size should be a parameter that is constant and does not have any dimensions (i.e., it is scalar).  There should be an error if this is not the case.
