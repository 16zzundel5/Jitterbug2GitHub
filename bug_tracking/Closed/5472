I expect this has something to with the recent changes I made.  The fact that
diffusibility status doesn't have an effect means it's probably not something to
do with the visitors.  But I'm not good enough at debugging reb2sac errors to
find out what the issue is and there aren't any exceptions or errors other than
the "BAD RETURN VALUE!!!" one.
