OK.  It turns out that fifoN2.csp was really a copy of fifoN3.csp
(each example had three stages).  Hao commented the extra stage out of
fifoN2.csp, but he did not do anything about fifoN2.PRS.night.  So the
nighttime regression test was pointing out that a stage of the
implementation had disappeared.  We fixed this by renaming (via CVS
commands) fifoN2.PRS.night to fifoN3.PRS.night.  Now the same tests
are getting run, and producing the same results.  Only the names have
changed.  
So everything is fine as of CVS tag GOOD217.
I will now close this report.
