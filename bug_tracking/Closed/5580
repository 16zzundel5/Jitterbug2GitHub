I'm assuming this is something to do with the flattening process.  Binding
reactions and basal/act production reactions are not being created, and there
aren't any bound RNAP species or compartment RNAP species being created.  Also,
RNAP and default__RNAP ARE being created (for any given grid model) and they
shouldn't be.
