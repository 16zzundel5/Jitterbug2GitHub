Subject: Re: FEATURE: scripting the java simulator (PR#5617)
Date: Fri Aug  3 20:31:26 2012

I've finally got internet again, so here are some belated instructions
for doing command line things with the dynamic simulator.  Let me know
if you have any trouble with it (or if my instructions are confusing).

1.  Get the ant build.xml (File -> Export -> Runnable JAR -> (Launch
config: DynSim, Save as ANT Script ("build.xml")) -- don't worry about
errors with the jar creation; you just want the ant file.
2.  Run "ant" in the same directory as the build.xml file to build the
runnable jar file
3.  Use jar file (java -jar file.jar) + these parameters: 1) model
dir, 2) output dir, 3) properties file dir

You can look at DynSim.java to see what happens.  I think all of the
properties are supported and stuff (in the readProperties method).
