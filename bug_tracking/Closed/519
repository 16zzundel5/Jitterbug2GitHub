I've found an example with no timing information that has a CSC violation
when running ATACS with no timing flags, BUT synthesizes under mg and ms.
Here is the example session:

128 xia:examples/tel> atacs -ltya csc
ATACS VERSION 4.1
Logging session in:  atacs.log
Loading timed event/level structure from:  csc.tel
Initializing 3 cycles ... done
Checking for cycles in acyclic constraint graph ... done.
Checking liveness ... live
Checking safety ... safe
Finding reduced state graph ... done (states=382,time=0.194454)
Projecting out dummy transitions ... done (0.019781)
Checking CSC ... NOT complete state coded
EXCEPTION:  CSC violation!
129 xia:examples/tel> atacs -mgltya csc
ATACS VERSION 4.1
Logging session in:  atacs.log
Using geometric timing to obtain state graphs.
