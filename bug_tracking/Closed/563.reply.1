The following command works:

atacs -mEmXmQmcmsmUmPmTmFmOmpya deco1

while this one does not:

atacs -mzmEmXmQmcmsmUmPmTmFmOmpya -de deco1

Therefore, the new postprocessing code is causing the problem.  

Hao: Please take a look at this example.

Eric P.: Please remove from nighttime regression until problem is fixed.
