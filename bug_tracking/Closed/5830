I think it would be helpful if there was a save all feature. If you exit the program with modifications in multiple files, iBioSim asks if you want to save the models so this should not be very difficult. 
If a change has been made to a model, a '*' symbol could be displayed on the tab label or gray out the save option if no changes have been made.
