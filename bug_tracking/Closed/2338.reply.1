Subject: Re: BUG: interesting species must include non-input (PR#2338)

The reason for this is that the default behavior is to remove no species by
irrelevant species abstraction unless species are specified as interesting. 
Therefore, an output species must be selected as interesting to keep the model
from being abstracted to nothing.  

Changed error message to say that there are no reactions in the model which is
more clear.
