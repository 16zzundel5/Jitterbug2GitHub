Okay. I see it now. But if I have a variable x whose initial value is,
say 0.5, and it has a constant rate of change of 0.03. In this case,
do we represent the values of x and its rate both as [0,1] when
converting into LPN? Or we have to scale them and other variable
values in the same model so that they become 50 and 3?
