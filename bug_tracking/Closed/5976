ch everywhere but Caracas, the capital. Worsening power 
outages, crumbling infrastructure and other unfulfilled promises witnessed 
this week in a trip through the country's industrial heartland could be 
an important factor in Sunday's election to replace socialist President 
Hugo Chavez, who died last month after a long battle with cancer.His 
political heir, Nicolas Maduro, is favored to win, largely on the strength 
of Chavez's generous anti-poverty programs, which Chavez emphasized over 
public works with one big exception: housing.But polls show that support 
may be eroding and the outages are a testament to the neglect 
many Venezuelans consider inexcusable in this major oil-producing state. 
Violent crime, double-digit inflation, official corruption and persistent 
food shortages are other factors.Some of the rolling, intermittent blackouts 
are still scheduled. But most are no longer announced. They generally last 
three to four hours a day on average, said Miguel Lara, who 
ran the power grid until Chavez forced him out in 2004 for 
being "a political risk."Jose Aguilar, a U.S.-based consultant with extensive 
and more recent experience in Venezuela's electrical industry, says it is 
suffering "a downward spiral of deterioration." Insufficient transmission 
lines are running so hot that 20,000 distribution transformers burned out 
last year, he said. "They run them cherry red."Electrical substations are 
in a precarious state, Aguilar and Lara s Texas. He said he will carefully evaluate the impact of 
a move on his business and its 150 employees."I have a very 
serious commitment to my employees, which is more than they got from 
their state legislators," he said.Malkowski and Scalise said they will meet 
with members of Connecticut's congressional delegation next Tuesday and 
Wednesday to counter lobbying from gun control advocates.An agreement between 
two conservative senators  Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican 
Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania  was expected to make it likelier that 
the Senate's initial vote Thursday to begin debating gun legislation will 
succeed. But the fate of gun legislation remains unclear, clouded by opposition 
from many Republicans and moderate Democrats in the Democratic-led Senate 
and Republican-run House."I have a duty to make sure they hear something 
from our side," Malkowski said.ars likely to list the sage grouse as an 
endangered species. Offering protections for the bird under the Endangered 
Species Act could severely restrict ranching, grazing, mining and other 
activities on public land in their states, the senators said.Risch lifted 
the hold after the Interior Department agreed in writing to use the 
best science available and work in a "collaborative" way with Idaho officials 
on the sage grouse."Only by working together can we achieve solutions that 
are acceptable to all parties," Risch said in a statement, adding that 
he was pleased Jewell agreed with that approach.
