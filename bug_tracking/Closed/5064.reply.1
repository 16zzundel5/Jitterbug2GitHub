Fixed.  PrintActivatedBindingVisitor and PrintRepressionBindingVisitor now
generate the specified rate laws, with the added caveat that Ka and Kr have been
moved inside the pow( , nc) expressions and are no longer implicitly raised to
nc.  To make the units work, Ka and Kr were made proper eq constants with units
of mol-1, and the forward rate terms were multiplied by kr (units of s-1).  In
the case of activated binding, an eq constant for RNAP binding the promoter with
units of mol-1 was also added.
