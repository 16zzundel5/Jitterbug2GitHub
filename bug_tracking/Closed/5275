There is a problem with the reactant. In SBML(level 3 version 1), an
assignment rule cannot be defined for a species that is created or destroyed
in a reaction unless that species is defined as a boundary condition in the
model. So instead of defining a reactant t (see below), a modifier is
defined. The change of this has been checked in.

When the persistent flag is true for a transition, t, with an exponential
delay, r,  should convert it to a rule, reaction, and event as follows:

Rule:
t = piecewise(1, (*t & e) | (*t & t), 0)

Reaction:
modifier  t
product tp
rate law  r * t

Event:
trigger tp
pers    false
delay  0
assignments
     *t = 0
      t* = 1
      <A>
