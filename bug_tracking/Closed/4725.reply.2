Please check again on the variable list which does not include the variable
being used in the existing assignment problem. 

Another potential problem I found and talked with Kevin about this is that when
ever we have a variable name that is a subset of another variable name the
variable name will not show up in the variable list. For example, I have
variable A and ADC1 variables in my nuke example. When I use ADC1 in the
assignment, variable A does not show up in the variable list.
