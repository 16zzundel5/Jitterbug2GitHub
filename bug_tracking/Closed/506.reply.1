OK.  I think the problem was that there was an 
	if(it's atacs -h) print help;
	else 
		do other stuff
With no braces around the do other stuff.  I think Chris neglected that 
when he expanded "do other stuff"  I added braces around all of it, and 
now it seems to work.

So this is fixed as of cvs tag hWorks
I will now close this report.
