There seems to be some issues with the analysis views still.

1) When a graph in the analysis view is selected, it does not  
highlight save as, export, and refresh.

2) Save and run does not work from toolbar or menu.  Save parameters  
also does not work.

Also, save as -> Menu does not work though the "Save As" works for an  
SBML editor.
