Subject: new Persistence rule violation in old TEL

Full_Name: Eric Robert Peskin
Version: cvs tag PR575

Submission from: dhcp-65-38.housing.utah.edu (155.101.65.38)
Submitted by: peskin


The tel structure for this report is atacs/examples/tel/pr575.tel
It is available as of cvs tag PR575.

However, to help with the debugging process, I will demonstrate the
change across the closest two tags between which it occurs:
The TEL structure drew no Persistence rule violation under cvs tag GOOD520.
The same TEL structure draws a Persistence rule violation under cvs
tag myersNewInterface.

The session below first demonstrates that the directory names
correspond to the tags, and then tries each executable on the same tel
structure.  Note that there is no automatic exception handling
attempted here.  Also note that one OS release is used for the whole
session.  I believe I am using equivalent flags to ATACS, but they
will look different, because the names have changed.
