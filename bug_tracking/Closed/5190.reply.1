Hi Nic,

I think I have this fixed.  There were a couple of bugs.

1) SBML output from reb2sac was not producing non-constant parameters.

2) An abstraction called "inducer structure transformer" was corrupting modifier
species references.  Actually, I cannot exactly remember what this abstraction
does, so I'm curious if it is doing something correctly to your model.  So,
please let me know if the abstracted model makes sense.  I don't think it
changes much.

Chris
