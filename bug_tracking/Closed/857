Chris,

I am looking for a way to tell where to look in the rulesADT for the
first occurance of an output (as I only need to fire the outputs).  I
thought that ninputs was the answer, but it is not apparently.  If you
look at the events for SPEC below, you will see that I want to start at
4.  I want to start at 5 for IMPL.  (0 based counting).  Both ninputs
are 4.

Is there a way to determine this, or do I have to string match the
outputs?

Nathan

Input Signals for SPEC: q
Output Signals for SPEC: z m
Events for SPEC: reset q+/1 q-/1 q+/2 z+/1 z-/1 z+/2 z-/2 m+/1 m-/1 m+/2
SPEC stats: nevents = 11, ninputs = 4, ninpsig = 1, nsignals = 3,
nplaces = 4

Input Signals for IMPL: z m
Output Signals for IMPL: q
Events for IMPL: reset z+/1 z-/1 m+/1 m-/1 q+/1 q-/1
IMPL stats: nevents = 7, ninputs = 4, ninpsig = 2, nsignals = 3, nplaces
= 3
