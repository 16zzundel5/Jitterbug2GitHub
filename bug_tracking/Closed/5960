Persistent transitions introduce a rule to deal with the need for a persistent enabling condition and non-persistent marking.  This rule has the form:

t0 = ({en} && (marking)) | ((marking) && t0))

It is the feedback which is a problem.  Need to see if we can find another way around this to avoid the circular dependency.
