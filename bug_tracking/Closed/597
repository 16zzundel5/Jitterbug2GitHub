If the user tries to change the gatedelay, this typically doesn't
happen until after the example is compiled.  For example, if you
provide both files and options to atacs via the Unix shell command
line, the files get compiled first, and then the flags get processed.
Consider the following:

../../src/atacs winery.vhd wine_shop.vhd patron.vhd wine_example3.vhd NEW_SHOP
-oXoqtsG0-1ysodde

Note that some of the rules are [0,inf].  These are the rules that the
compiler created.  Also note that other rules have [0,1].  These are
the rules that my hse.[hc]pp code added.  This, despite the fact that
my code in the compiler to create the channel-level TEL for sends and
receives uses {min,max}gatedelay.

If instead, you are running atacs interactively, you do get an
opportunity to change the gatedelay before you load in the files.  But
you synthesize, change gatedelay, and then synthesize again, it does
not recompile the VHDL.  So the compiled part of the TEL structure
still has the old delays.

Also, it doesn't really matter now that I've changed MAXGATEDELAY to
INFINITY, but just FYI, there's no way to specify infinity when
changing the gatedelay from the unix shell command line.
