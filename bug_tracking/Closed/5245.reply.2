I tried out A->B, and I think it at least gives something with correct units
though perhaps a bit counter-intuitive.  I think though that I like this form of
the equation a little bit better (it is equivalent to the earlier form):

kf * (Keq)^{n-2} * A^n - kr * B

where kf has units of (mole^-1 s^-1) and kr has units of (s^-1) and Keq = kf/kr.
 You may also give a simpler form for a couple of special cases:

n=2: kf * A^2 - kr * B
n=1: kr * A - kr * B

I still find the n=1 case to be counter-intuitive, but units wise it is correct.
 Namely, kr is the stand-in for (s^-1) units.  I guess another solution would be
to treat this as a special case where you assume that kf has units (s^-1), and
create a formula of: kf * A - kr * B.  In this case, Keq=kf/kr would be
dimensionless.  What do you think?
