I was trying to create an example using reactions but I run into a problem.=
 I did the following:

created constant parameter n =3D 5;
created species A[n][n]
created species B[n][n]
created species C[n][n]
created compartment Cell[n][n]
created reaction reaction[n][n] A+B->C index math [d0][d1]

Currently there is a problem with the function that checks if it is statica=
lly computable so when you press OK, an error message pops up. When this ha=
ppens, the counter you use to keep track of the dimension doesn't reset. Th=
is means if I try to press OK again, you are going to end up with dimension=
Ids =3D {d2,d3} and so on.
