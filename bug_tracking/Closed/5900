Submitted by: nroehner


Having multiple DNA components with the same URI distributed between different
SBOL files in a project leads to duplicate components showing up in the SBOL
browser (not fatal) and can lead to exceptions when writing with libSBOL due to
multiple data structures having the same URI (fatal).
