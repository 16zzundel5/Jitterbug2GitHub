Subject: Re: Add switch to determine of TELs table is cleared on compile. (PR#184)

I have added the switch "newtab" which selects whether the TELs table is
deleted
at the end of a compilation.  The default is that the TELs table is not
deleted.
When you select newtab, then at the end of the next compile, the TELs table is
deleted.  In other words, if you run a couple of compiles, then set newtab, the
next compile will still have the old compiles in the TELs table, but the 
TELs table will be deleted at the end of the present compile.

A couple of ways this can be tested and used.  
1) Comment out the include statements in a csp/hse file.  Then, load the files
   from the include line, followed by the top level file.  It should compile 
   fine and find all the needed modules.  If newtab is selected first though, 
   it will not be able to find the modules.
2) Change the name of a vhdl file to not match the entity name.  Then, a
compile
   of the top level first will not work, but if you first compile the lower
level
   entities, followed by the top level, it will find the prior compilations.
