Subject: BUG: species list not updated when species added
Date: Fri, 20 May 2011 10:31:43 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

When species is added to the schematic, does not immediately show up  
in the species list.

Vice versa does not work at all.  When you add a species to list, does  
not show up on schematic.

Seems that they also do not show up in the event assignment list either.
