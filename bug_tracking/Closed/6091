located next door in this cozy.. inviting, relaxing home-like building. We ordered a bottle of red wine and sat outside on one of the many benches. Inside, there is cozy seating as well. Our bartender was extremely sweet and came by several times to check on us. The wait is long, yes-BUT if you have some alcoholic beverages in your veins it makes the wait almost a delight. Its a great date idea or, just like in my case, a great way to get you know your friends better. Meg and I talked, shared stories, took silly pictures, and giggled into the evening. We were approached by one of the friendly staff members after almost three hours of waiting and once seated, were greeted immediately by a equally friendly server. The non alcoholic beverage choices were standard, until I saw "Bubble Up" a lemon lime esque beverage. I requested the seemingly refreshing drink, but was told "we are out". This restaurant is only open a couple days a week, for a handful of hours.. and they're OUT of something? Interesting. I got ginger ale instead-which was pretty yummy. On the to the FOOD. Spiedini - Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma, served warm as an appetizer. Pretty much cheese and ham... just uber expensive. Not worth $9.00 at all. We ordered two pizzas. The ROSA  (Red Onion, Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosemary, AZ Pistachios) and the BIANCOVERDE (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula) The pizza came quick, and the portions are quite generous. Of the two pizzas, the Rosa was VERY salty. Too salty. I'm struggling to recall the actual taste of this pizza since all I can remember is the saltiness of it. The Biancoverde was my favorite of the two. The cheese is beyond delicious and the arugula on top gave the pizza an outstanding appearance and unique taste. The reasoning for the moderate rating on Pizzeria Bianco is simply due to the overall experience. The wait, although enjoyable, is something I do not see myself enduring again. Its, in my modest opinion, an overrated restaurant. Honestly, after waiting for three hours on an empty stomach, I think one would appreciate consuming ANY food.  Sure, the ingredients are beyond amazing, and the wood burning HUGE stove is quite a
