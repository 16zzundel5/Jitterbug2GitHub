Subject: Re: BUG: saving SBML linked to a gcm should update analysis view (PR#4516)
Date: Mon Aug 18 16:18:24 2008

It seems that if the gcm editor was closed but the gcm was still linked to the
sbml, then the update wouldn't happen.  I think I have fixed this now.  Try it
out and let me know if it's still isn't working.
