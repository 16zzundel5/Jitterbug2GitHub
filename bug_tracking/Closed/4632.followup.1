I think the problem is still there.  I get the problem by doing the  
following:

Create a new LHPN
Add a place p1
Add a transition t1
Add a flow relation from p1 to t1
Edit place p1 and change its name to p

At this point, the name in the flow relation is indeed updated, but  
when you look at the list of choices for the flow relation, it still  
includes p1 as one of the possible entries.  Also, if I save at this  
point, it creates an empty file (i.e., it likely throws an exception,  
make sure you are only catching IOExceptions, so you can see this  
problem).
