I'm still having some problems.  In the square wave example with  
variables A, B, and C.  I do the following:

1) Set A and C to be inputs with 2 bins and use suggest levels to fill  
in the thresholds.  Change C threshold to 0.55.
2) Open lhpn for this example and remove C.  When I save I get and  
error "Unable to Save Thresholds".   When I look at the thresholds, B  
is now an input.
3) Add C back into the LHPN and save again.  When I add C back in, C  
becomes and input while B is no longer an input.  However, B now has  
the threshold of 0.55 while C has taken the threshold of 0.5 (i.e.,  
they have swapped thresholds).

Any ideas?

Chris
