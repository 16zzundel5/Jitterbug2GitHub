Subject: Re: FEATURE: add support for non-disabling semantics to LPNs (PR#5178)
Date: Fri Nov 26 21:03:35 2010

The transitions are now marked with a "disabling" boolean, which is true if the
transition's enabling condition is 
disabling.  Transitions with non-disabling semantics are denoted in the .lpn
file by being listed on a ".non-
disabling" line similar to the failure transition line.
