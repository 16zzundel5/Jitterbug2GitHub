Subject: CHANGE: set 32-bit java path in an environment variable
Date: Wed, 3 Nov 2010 14:27:22 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

Currently the Java path is added to the user path in Windows.  This is  
a problem for 64-bit machines as the 64-bit virtual machine shows up  
first in the system path.  To solve this problem, add a new  
environment variable to the batch file which has the full path to the  
32-bit java virtual machine.
