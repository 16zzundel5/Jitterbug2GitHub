Yes, that works.  Thanks!
The bad news is that for the example of that bug report, which is now:
	/home/ming/peskin/atacs/work/er/selector1.er
the CSC solver causes deadlock.  (At least using atacs -ys selector1.er)
But I'll save that for another bug report.
As for whether other exception handling can overwrite ER or TEL structures, I
can't remember any other case off hand.
So for now, I will close this bug report.  If it comes up again, we can always
submit a new one.
