Ching helped me find the solution to this.  See:

Basically, I just moved the waitFor after the reading of the input stream.  This
also allowed me to change things so that the input stream is immediately written
into the command window.  Please check out what I have done, and when you are
satisfied with it, then go ahead and close this issue.

Cheers,

Chris
