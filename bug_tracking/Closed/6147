In all places where there is an index field, it should be enabled only when the object being index requires an index (i.e., has dimensions).  This has been implemented for conversionFactor, but it still needs to be implemented for:

1) Rules
2) Event assignments
3) Species references
4) Compartment for species
5) Compartment for reactions
