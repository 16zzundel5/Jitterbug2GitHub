Subject: feature request
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Feature to choose which abstraction methods to use and the order
of the abstraction methods.
-- To dynamically implement this feature without using JNI to allow
the GUI to communicate with reb2sac directly at runtime, a special
directory which contains files for all the available abstraction
methods can be created.   Each file contains the description of the
corresponding abstraction method (i.e., method ID, method display
name, properties used in the method, etc).
