I fixed this issue by reloading rather than recreating the tab.  However, it
takes two saves of the SBML file before 
the SBOL file reflects the change.  It is almost like it saves the SBOL file
before generating the SBOL for the model.  
I could not find where the file actually gets pushed to disk.  Could you check
this for me?

Thanks,

Chris
