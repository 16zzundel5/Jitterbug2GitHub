Create a reaction when you create a promoter with the name of that promoter.

Add any customized parameters to the list of parameters.

Create a rate law of the form:

ng * ko * Ko * RNAP / (1 + Ko * RNAP)

For each influence on this promoter, add that species as a modifier which is annotated with the type of the influence.  Also, add customizations for the binding rates, if necessary.  Construct an updated rate law.

For each species produced from this promoter, add a product to this reaction with stoichiometry of np.  Need to add an ID to the reference and add an assignment rule assigns this reference id to np.
