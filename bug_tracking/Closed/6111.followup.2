Would be better to detect "conversionFactor" and report "Conversion Factor".

Also, there are other messages that are given for indices besides too few and too many.  They also need an indication of what they are referring too.  Actually, all the error messages for dimensions and indices need to give this indication.  

Also, bracket is misspelled in your error messages.

Finally, if I put an empty index, I get a "String must end in closing bracket error" when it should say too few indices.  Actually, even when no index is required, it is still giving me this error.
