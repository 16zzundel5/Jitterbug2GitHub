All right. Then it might be best for me to add a check in my code to see if Gui.separator has been set yet, and if not, then set it.

What we need is a value always accessible.  The reason for Gui.separator is that
File.separator does not
work on windows.  It needs to be escaped.  Namely, \\ must be changed to \\\\.
We could move it from Gui
to another class which is always constructed even for GUI-less code.
