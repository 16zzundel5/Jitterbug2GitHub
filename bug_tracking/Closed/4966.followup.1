I just checked, and I don't think ranges on Boolean assignments is  
legal.  One potential way to handle the unknown case is to use a  
bernoulli random function which returns 0 or 1 with a given  
probability.  Assuming, 0 and 1 are mapped to false and true, this  
essentially represents an unknown Boolean state.
