The Homeland Security Department ordered border agents "effective immediately" 
to verify that every international student who arrives in the U.S. has 
a valid student visa, according to an internal memorandum obtained Friday 
by The Associated Press. The new procedure is the government's first security 
change directly related to the Boston bombings.The order from a senior official 
at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David J. Murphy, was circulated Thursday 
and came one day after the Obama administration acknowledged that a student 
from Kazakhstan accused of hiding evidence for one of the Boston bombing 
suspects was allowed to return to the U.S. in January without a 
valid student visa.The student visa for Azamat Tazhayakov had been terminated 
when he arrived in New York on Jan. 20. But the border 
agent in the airport did not have access to the information in 
the Homeland Security Department's Student and Exchange Visitor Information 
System, called SEVIS.Tazhayakov was a friend and classmate of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's 
at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Tazhayakov left the U.S. in 
December and returned Jan. 20. But in early January, his student-visa status 
was terminated because he was academically dismissed from the university.Tazhayakov 
and a second Kazakh student were arrested this week on federal charges 
of obstruction of justice. They were accused of helping to get rid 
of a backpack containing fireworks linked to Tsarnaev. A thiHiring picked up in April after a slow couple months, as employers 
added 165,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dipped to a four-year low 
of 7.5 percent.The Labor Department report showed positive signs though 
the economic recovery remains shaky. A mix of government spending cuts and 
tax hikes has threatened to curb economic growth, which is already slow 
in a post-recession environment.The jobless rate dipped only slightly, from 
7.6 percent to 7.5 percent. The government also revised up its estimate 
of job gains in February and March by a combined 114,000. It 
now says employers added 332,000 jobs in February and 138,000 in March.Stock 
prices soared on the heels of the report, with the Dow surging 
past 15,000 for the first time ever an hour after trading began.The 
economy has created an average of 208,000 jobs a month from November 
through April. That's above the 138,000 added in the previous six months.The 
only sectors of the economy that cut jobs last month were construction 
and governmentEconomic figures in recent days have been mixed. The government 
said Thursday that the number of Americans applying for unemployment aid 
fell last week to a seasonally adjusted 324,000 -- the fewest since 
January 2008.At the same time, surveys have shown that hiring by private 
companies was weak and that manufacturing activity declined in April. And 
exports fell in March.The economy grew in the January-March quarter at an 
annual pace of 2.5 percent, mHes gone from most wanted to least wanted.Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan 
Tsarnaevs family in Russia doesnt want his body, his widow declined to 
claim it and now cemeteries in Massachusetts have refused to take the 
body. The corpse has languished in a city morgue since April 19, 
when he was killed in a shootout with police, but now it 
is being prepared for burial somewhere in or around Boston. The remains 
were originally taken to Dyer-Lake Funeral Home in North Attleboro late 
Thursday, prompting crowds to jeered and jab middle fingers in the air 
as the hearse passed by."They can protest, but what do you do? 
In this country, we bury the dead," Peter Stefan, owner of Graham 
Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlor, told Fox News. Stefan has agreed to 
handle the funeral arrangements.- Peter Stefan, owner of Graham Putnam and 
Mahoney Funeral ParlorStefan said everybody deserves a dignified burial 
service no matter the circumstances of their death and said he is 
prepared for protests. But he added that arrangements have yet to be 
worked out, and finding a final resting plot for the body - 
which Islamic law says must not be cremated - could prove difficult.Massachusetts 
cemetery officials told FoxNews.com graveyards typically dont turn away 
families, no matter how much the public might revile the deceased. In 
the case of Tsarnaev, Boyle suggested the family might opt for the 
most inconspicuous option available - if they can find a cemetery that
