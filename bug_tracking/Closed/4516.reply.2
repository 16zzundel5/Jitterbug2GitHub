Subject: Re: BUG: saving SBML linked to a gcm should update analysis view (PR#4516)
Date: Tue Jul 29 14:30:25 2008

While this updates the information in the parameter editor, it does not appear
to update the local SBML file.  Namely, if you change a constraint in the SBML
file, this update does not appear until the simulation view is closed and
re-opened.
