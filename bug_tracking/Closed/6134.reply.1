I'm going to need clarification on this one. I don't think this can be settled
in checkSizeParameters and checkIndices. My understanding is that the String
inputted in the ID textbox goes like this:
id[dim n][dim n-1]...[dim 0]

Is this correct?

I think you wanted me to take this input and reverse it so that it still works
for my storage code. However, I believe that I must also adjust my reading code
so that when an object is opened the user sees it in the format matching above.
