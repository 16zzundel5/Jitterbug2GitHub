Actually, this has a couple problems.  First, if the time printed is  
not integral, then the progress is not computed correctly.  Namely, if  
the value is 0 to 10 with a time step of 0.1, then it prints 10  
percent for all values 1.0, 1.1, etc.

Secondly, if there are multiple runs then the run number also needs to  
be considered.  Namely, the return from simulation is either a run  
number or time.  Currently, when the first run concludes, it reports  
100 percent.
