Subject: BUG: Abstraction option not saved correctly between tasks in analysis view
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

This happens when switching from a saved task to another in analysis
view. When switching from a task with "Reaction-based" abstraction
option to a different task without any abstraction, the
"Reaction-based" abstraction option, however, does not switch to
"None", but rather stays unchanged.
