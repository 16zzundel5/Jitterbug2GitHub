Subject: BUG: VHDL compiler does not convert std_logic_vector value to integer
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

It does not convert the value specified in std_logic_vector to an
integer in LPN. The example file, producer.vhd, located at
/home/ming/zhangz/nobackup/research/myThesis/models/vhdl_lpn/producer_consumer/channel_comm,
assigns std_logic_vector "11" to "data", and the compiled LPN assigns
integer 11 to the "data" variable.
