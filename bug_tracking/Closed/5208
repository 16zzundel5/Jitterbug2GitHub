Subject: BUG improper species names for components with associated SBML files

So I have a component with an associated SBML file.  This SBML file contains
species which have the same name as species in the component, let's say S1, S2,
and S3.  When I generate SBML from the GCM containing this component, I end up
with six species named C1__S1, C1_S1, C1__S2, C1_S2, C1__S3, and C1_S3.  It
seems that the code which handles merging an SBML file associated with a
component is failing to name species with a double underscore.
