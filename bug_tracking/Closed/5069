Subject: FEATURE: additional feature request on reb2sac simulator

Some suggestions on modifications of reb2sac simulator.
1. It allows the user to pause the simulation and perform single step
simulation.
2. It should also display the states of all variables as the user steps
through simulation.
3. It should be able to display, after a single step is performed, the next
possible path(s) and allow the user to choose one of them. If no selection
is made by the user, the simulator should choose an event to fire based on
the delay and priority information.
