Chris fixed this with some modifications to your VHDL file.
The new version is checked into the examples submodule of the CVS module atacs.
It is called killpack.vhd.  The results I got are called killpack.prs.gold.
I am assuming these results are correct, so I will now close this report.
But let me know if you disagree.
