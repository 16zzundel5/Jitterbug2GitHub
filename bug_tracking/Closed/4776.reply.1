Model this after the learn view.  Except add a check box for interesting
species.  No abstraction, should be all grey.  Abstraction should allow all
species to be marked interesting but no thresholds can be set.  Logical
abstraction should allow only GCM species to be marked interesting and
interesting species can have thresholds set.
