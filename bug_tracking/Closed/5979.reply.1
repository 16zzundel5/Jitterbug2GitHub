I am having an issue with trying to annotate a Matrix. It seems to run fine, but
after the annotations of both indecies are complete I get this message:
"14/03/21 15:32:45 WARN parsers.XMLNodeReader: The type of String 'annotation'
on the element constraint is unknown !! Some data might be lost"

Any thoughts?

P.S. I have not yet combined vectorIndex and MatrixIndex at this point.
