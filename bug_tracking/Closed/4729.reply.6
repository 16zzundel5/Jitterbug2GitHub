I changed how the view menu gets enabled in LEMA.  Namely, I added a view
learned model option to both iBioSim and LEMA, and I associated all of the other
learn menu items with the file tree (not the learn view tab).  I'm not sure if
this is the desired behavior since I don't use learn views in LEMA.  Let me know
if this isn't correct and I'll fix the menu so each item is associated correctly
with either the file tree or the learn view tab.  Moving to needs testing.
