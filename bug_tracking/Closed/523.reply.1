Note that this example is completely untimed, and I ran it untimed.

As I recall, part of the definition of a Safe Transformation is that
it must not change the un-timed semantics of the net.

But Transformation 4 introduces a safety violation into an un-timed example.

Does this constitute changing the un-timed semantics?
