If ATACS needs write a new ER (e.g., to handle an exception), 
and the spec was itself an .er, ATACS should pick a 
new file name (or directory) for the new ER.  Currently, it does not.

If CVS watching is on, and the spec in question is not being cvs edited,
then this bug exposes the seg fault of report 248.
See that report for a sample session.

On the other hand, if you had just changed the specification, and you had not
yet cvs committed said changes, ATACS could clobber your work!
