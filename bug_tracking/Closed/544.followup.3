The problem appears to be that on RH7 it picks one insertion point and RH6
picks a different one.  This is likely due to some changes in the STL
containers on what order things get stored.  The reason it succeeds on RH7
and fails on RH6 is simply dumb luck.  It is well known that the CSC
solver does not work on all examples or with all insertion point
selections.  In this case, the choice for RH6 ends up with a blank in the
state vector.  This is due to a start state which is not found in a cycle.
