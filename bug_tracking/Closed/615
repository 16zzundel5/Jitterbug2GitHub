Subject: POSETS differs with Geometric/Bap

The following command reports 54 states:

atacs -oa -cP -cR -on -ts -va poset_err stage2

while these commands report 52 states:

atacs -oa -cP -cR -on -tg -va poset_err stage2
atacs -oa -cP -cR -on -tp -va poset_err stage2
atacs -oa -cP -cR -on -ts -va poset_err

In other words, geometric and bap agree there should be 52 states and posets 
also agrees when no module is selected.  The problem is the following trace:

$clk+, $ack6-, $x0t+, $x5t-, x1t+, $ack5+, x2t+, $x3t+, $x4t+

In this state (state 38:11F), ack_stage2- should occur next, but the command
on top allows $ack_stage4- to happen first leading to a new state.

Similarly, in state 22:00R, ack_stage2+ should occur next, but $ack_stage4+
is allowed to happen first in the top command.
