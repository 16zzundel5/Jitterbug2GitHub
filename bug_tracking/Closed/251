Among the *.unc files in the bm directory,
the marked graphs and two free-choice net 
("dean-cache-ctrl.unc" and "dram-ctrl.unc")
could be converted to STG and synthesized successfully
without modifying anything. 
But I'm not sure that the synthesized circuits are correct.

Other specifications have complex loops.
And it is necessary add token between dummy events to 
solve cycle detection error.
