User interface to specify what the user is interested in analyzing
using his/her model.
This can be simplified to 3 sub items:

*  User interface to specify sets of states which the user is
interested in knowing whether or not reaching.
--  For example, in the type 1 pili phase variation model, we are
interested in knowing the probability of ON-to-OFF switching for one
cell generation.  This can be measured by counting the number of
simulation runs where the molecular count of artificial species
"switch" reaches 1 within the simulation time limit given the initial
molecular count of "switch"
is 0, and dividing this number by the number of the total simulation runs.
So, in this case, the user would specify "switch >= 1" as the set of
states that the user is interested in.

*  User interface to specify the independent variable for looping of
simulations for various initial conditions, and which and how
parameters or species' initial conditions, if any, change    based on
the change in the independent variable.
-- For example, in the ON-to-OFF switching  analysis, the independent
variable is a temperature, and some parameter values and the initial
concentrations of some species change based on the temperature.

*  Ability to visualize the results using the features 5.1 and 5.2.
-- For example,  in the ON-to-OFF switching  analysis,  the user would
like to see how the switching probabilities change based on the change
in temperature, i.e., visualizing the switching probabilities as a
function of the temeperature.
