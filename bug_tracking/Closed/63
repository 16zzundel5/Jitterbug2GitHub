Atacs appears to have generated incorrect VHDL for TRACES. I really don't
understand everything associated with the VHDL stuff, but I thought it might
be cool to use this new bug submit program!

The following is the code:

library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
entity TRACE is
end TRACE;

architecture BEHAVIORAL of TRACE is
	signal evalstart : std_logic;
	signal phi2 : std_logic;
	signal Gclk : std_logic;
	signal phi1 : std_logic;
	signal phi3 : std_logic;
	signal out22 : std_logic;
	signal out8 : std_logic;
	signal out6 : std_logic;
	signal out4 : std_logic;
	signal out2 : std_logic;
	signal out1 : std_logic;
	signal out3 : std_logic;
	signal out5 : std_logic;
	signal out7 : std_logic;
	signal out21 : std_logic;
	signal out31 : std_logic;
begin
process
begin
	Gclk <= '1' after 551 ns;
	Gclk <= '0' after 901 ns;
	phi1 <= '0' after 1188 ns;
	phi1 <= '1' after 838 ns;
	phi3 <= '1' after 1082 ns;
	phi2 <= '1' after 948 ns;
end process;
end BEHAVIORAL;

The corrected chuck of code should look like this (notice the transport and the
wait):

begin
	Gclk <= transport '1' after 551 ns;
	Gclk <= transport '0' after 901 ns;
	phi1 <= transport '1' after 838 ns;
	phi1 <= transport '0' after 1188 ns;
	phi2 <= transport '1' after 948 ns;
	phi3 <= transport '1' after 1082 ns;
	wait;
end process;
