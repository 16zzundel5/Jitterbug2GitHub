I'm going to need a little bit of advice on how to go about saving the dimension
information to the event assignment.

Because the event assignment object is parsed from the list of event
assignments, all storing and loading functions involved the
construction/deconstruction of the strings in this list.

If we are to continue this method I need to design the program to add text to
the string and then reconfigure the string splitting to store and load this
information.

This is now a design problem...
