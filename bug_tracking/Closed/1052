The railroad example is fixed.  From my notes, it looks like the Fischer 
protocol was the only other one with a parentheses error.  When I tried 
parsing that, it appeared to still have problems (lines 100 and 101 of 
fish2.tel).  I may have made a mistake while parsing, as I initially did 
when checking the railroad example, but I think that it's worth looking 
into.  - Kevin Jones
