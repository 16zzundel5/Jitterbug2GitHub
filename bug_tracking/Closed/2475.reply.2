Subject: Re: CHANGE: do not remove species used in rules, events, or constraints (PR#2475)
Date: Wed Feb 13 15:04:15 2008

See ApplyModifierConstantPropagationMethod in
Modifier_constant_propagation_abstraction_method.c

Need to check if species is used updated by event or rule, and skip if it is.

Need to also propagate constant into math for events, rules, and constraints.
