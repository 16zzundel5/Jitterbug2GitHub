You cannot specify two files on the same command line.  The command:

atacs -msmUmPmTmc -lc lapbsv -ya lapb2

is interpreted to mean that lapb2 is the component you want to synthesize.
The format is:

atacs <options> <filename> <options> <component> <options>

Notice that options can interleave around filename and component name with
no effect.  They are stripped out first.  

Doing the same steps above in the interactive interface yields the correct
result.
