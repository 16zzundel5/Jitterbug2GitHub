For the example below, the dummy event between [a] and the choice should not
be postprocessed away.  In other words, it should be possible to observe [a]
then when the choice is made, a no longer needs to be high.

For this same example, posets gets an invalid matrix for the TEL structure
currently being generated.

module postp;

output a = {<1,2>};
input b;
input c;
output d;
output e;

process main;
*[ a+; a-; [ b -> d+; [~b]; d-
           | c -> e+; [~c]; e-
           ]
 ]
endprocess

process env;
*[ [a]; [ true -> b+; [d]; b-; [~d]
        | true -> c+; [e]; c-; [~e]
        ]
 ]
endprocess
endmodule
