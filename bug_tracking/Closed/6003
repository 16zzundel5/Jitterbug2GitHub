A constitutional attorney says the possibility that Foxnews.com reporter 
Jana Winter could go to jail for refusing to reveal her sources 
for a story in the aftermath of the Aurora movie massacre is 
enough for the government to re-evaluate state Shield laws.David Rivkin, 
who appeared on Fox & Friends Sunday, said there needs to be 
a national solution that would never put any reporter in that situation.In 
2012, Winter wrote an exclusive story detailing how alleged gunman James 
Holmes sent a package to a University of Colorado psychiatrist that included 
a notebook "full of details about how he was going to kill 
people," according to one of her sources.Rivkin said Holmes lawyers believe 
they wont get a fair trial if they dont know Winters source.Its 
a very weak argument, Rivkin said.Rivkin explained that New York, where 
Winter is based, has an Absolute Shield Law that protects reporters from 
revealing their sources. However, New York courts decided that Winters situation 
should be looked at under Colorado Shield laws, which contain exceptions 
that may allow reporters to testify.This whole story to me demonstrates 
that there is a need for a national solution, Rivkin said.Click for 
full coverage of Fox News' First Amendment fight. claimed to be based in Saudi Arabia paralyzed the websites of 
Israel's stock exchange and national airline and claimed to have published 
details of thousands of Israeli credit cards.A concerted effort to cripple 
Israeli websites during November fighting in Gaza failed to cause serious 
disruption. Israel said at the time that protesters barraged Israel with 
more than 60 million hacking attempts.An official of the militant Hamas 
movement that rules the Gaza Strip praised the current attack. "God bless 
the minds and the efforts of the soldiers of the electronic battle," 
Ihab Al- Ghussian, Gaza's chief government spokesman, wrote on his official 
Facebook page.ROME  A corner of a big Rome piazza, known for hosting 
free rock concerts and political rallies, will be renamed after late pontiff 
John Paul II, with Pope Francis coming to the unveiling ceremony Sunday.While 
Francis instantly proved to be a crowd pleaser  about 100,000 people 
turned out in St. Peter's Square Sunday and a nearby street for 
his noon blessing  the mention of the widely beloved John Paul 
still prompts affectionate cheers. When Francis noted that John Paul "closed 
his eyes to this world" exactly eight years ago this month, in 
2005, the new pope drew so much applause, he couldn't finish his 
sentence as he spoke from the papal studio window overlooking St. Peter's 
Square.Francis invited people to join him later in Rome's main church, St. 
John in Lateran Basilica. Pontiffs are also the bishop of Rome, and 
a traditional installation ceremony at the basilica formally recognizes 
that Francis is Rome's bishop as well as the leader of the 
worldwide Roman Catholic church.Before entering the basilica, Francis was 
scheduled to attend the unveiling of a plaque on a corner of 
the square near the church, naming that part of the piazza after 
John Paul. The late pontiff enthusiastically embraced his role as Rome's 
bishop, visiting hundreds of city parishes on Sunday mornings.Francis might 
be the pope who decides whether another miracle has been attributed to 
John Paul's intercession, which would enable the late, Polish-born pontiff
