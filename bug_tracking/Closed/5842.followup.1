Hi Dr. Myers,

I doubled checked and I do have the Use Infix Expression Parse checked.  I played around with it checked vs. unchecked and it seems that the difference is this:  Either way, I will always get a "Formula is not valid" error if I try to use the infix notation.  However, if the box is checked, once I enter a formula such as "eq(a,b)", it will accept the formula but the next time that I open the function to edit it the formula will be rewritten as "a == b".  Since it is now rewritten using infix notation I must change it back to "eq(a,b)" if I want to make any slight changes.  Is this different from how it is working on your computer?

-Jeff

Please go to the preferences and make sure that "Use Infix Expression Parser" is
selected.  If not, please select it
and you should be able to use the infix notation.
