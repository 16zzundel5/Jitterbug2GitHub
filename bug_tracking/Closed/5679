I think there is a problem with metaIds in array flattening.  Namely, when save a grid model, I'm getting a merged file has inconsistencies error and it complains about the diffusion reaction have non-unique metaIds.  I suspect that perhaps in array flattening that the reactions created are not getting unique metaIds.
