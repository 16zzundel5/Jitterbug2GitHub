Version: Veribest 2000.0
OS: Microsoft Windows NT 4.00.1381 on VMware 1.1.2 build-364 for Linux

Submission from: zorac.elen.utah.edu (155.99.23.220)


I am having trouble with the Mini-MIPS files.  When I try to download
everything
from the book web page, Veribest reports an "unspecified error" on each of the
.blk files and on the dlx.sbk file.

This problem first occured under VMware.  So I tried on qin.  Same thing.

Then I poked around on qin and found what I believe to be your originals of
these files in c:\users\default\ These worked fine on qin.  So I ftped these 
to our Linux systems and from there back down to zorac.  They worked fine on 
zorac too.

So the trouble happens when and only when I try to download them from the web.
