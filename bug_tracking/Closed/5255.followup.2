There is another bug that is causing this problem which I've already logged=
.  We've changed stoichiometry of binding from nc to ns which is the same n=
ame we use for initial species count.  Whenever you try to load an analysis=
 view where you have modified both of these, it will only be able to load o=
ne of the modifications because it will only be able to find the most recen=
t ns in the hashmap.  To fix this problem, we need to either change stoichi=
ometry of binding or initial species count to something other than ns.
