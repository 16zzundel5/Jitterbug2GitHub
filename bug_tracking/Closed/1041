command: atacs -cPlvsgll railroadcontroller.vhd
Submission from: song.ece.utah.edu (155.98.27.208)
Submitted by: kjones


When railroadcontroller.vhd is compiled by the tools developed by the group, the
multiple signal conditions are not correctly processed if two signal conditions
exist in the same line of a process, viz., in the form <condition_1> and
<condition_2>,.  The second condition is ignored, and the parentheses are
incorrectly matched in railroadcontroller.tel.
