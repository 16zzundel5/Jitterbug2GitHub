Make clean showed the problem.  Not sure what I did wrong the first time.  
Likely I had something stale somewhere...  I also had a pretty good idea 
what caused it and maybe I commented out the lines and recompiled before I 
ran the examples.  Likely some brain cramp on my end.  Anyway, it seems to 
be working now with the offending lines commented out (see previous 
reply).
