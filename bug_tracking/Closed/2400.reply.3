To fix this bug, I created a new class, Reb2SacThread, that extends the Thread
class and passed it the name of the directory to simulate.  Then, when the
thread is started, it calls a special version of the run method in the Reb2Sac
class that takes the desired simulation directory as a parameter.  This way, the
directory is passed as a parameter and simulated on instead of being set as a
global variable that could potentially be changed by another thread before it is
actually used.
