Subject: BUG: Learn tool does not suggest bin levels and does not learn.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by chou.ece.utah.edu id r1954xRV000544

Bug reported by: jeffrey.theisen@utah.edu

Description:
I followed the directions in the learn tool tutorial based on our homework assignment.  The data seemed to be imported correctly.  However, when I selected “use user generated levels” and clicked “suggest levels” the tool does not generate any levels.  It appears that nothing happens, although an execution statement appears in the lower panel: 
“Executing:
GeneNet --readLevels --lvl . /home/jeff/iBioSim/Projects/Tutorial-Learn/learnLambda”
I also tried selecting “use auto generated levels” and then pressing the “save and run button.”  This returns an error message that says “Unable to learn from data.”
Also, it may be useful to know that I am running this on xubuntu 12.04.
