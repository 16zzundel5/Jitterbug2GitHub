The following items are not displayed:

0) Functions have been flattened in math uses of them.

1) Names for all items with names.

2) Multiplier for unit may be incorrect due to bug.

3) Compartment and species types.

4) Initial assignments.

5) Constraint messages.

6) Reactions are missing reversible, fast, and stoichiometry math.

7) Reaction parameters are flattened.

Make more things into tables?
