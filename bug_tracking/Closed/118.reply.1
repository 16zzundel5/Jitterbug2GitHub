I have added the directory to the top of the fileselect window and into the
filename field on the window.  The default filter for loadcsp is CSP and
similarly
for other types of load.  Now, all commands will pull up a fileselect window
when no design is currently selected.  This allows a doall for example to 
be same as "doall <filename>" in atacs interactive.  There is a NEW button that
is used to clear the current working design.
