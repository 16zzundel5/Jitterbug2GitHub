With the current build, the segmentation fault is gone.

BUT, the syntax error on the multi-line comment is still there.  See my new
bug report 134.

If I split the comment into one on each line, the modified csp does not
deadlock.  It goes all the way to .prs, even without inTerleave.
Therefore, I am closing this report (but see 134).
