I got the following errors on Mac OS 10.6 after updating BioSim.
"Error: could not link with the libSBML library.  It is likely
your DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable does not include
the directory containing the libsbml library file."
The path for DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to /Users/zhangz/myBioSim/BioSim/lib64,
which is the same as before.
