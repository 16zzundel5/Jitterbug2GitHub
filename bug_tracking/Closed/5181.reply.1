This can get complicated when more than one species is swept, especially if they
are swept on different levels.  In this case, there isn't one definitive species
to put in place of time in the tsd file.  Shall we only generate this constraint
termination file if only one species is swept or should we think about how to
generate one or more tsd files for all swept species?
