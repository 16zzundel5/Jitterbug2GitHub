The problem appears to be in project.  In the untimed case, project creates a
CSC violations.  In the timed case, it folds the two states together which have
the CSC violation.  While no longer a CSC violations, the state 110R0R
introduces a output choice which should be marked as a failure also.  This
should be checked for, but is likely not a common issue.  Moving to potential
problem.
