I'm not sure about the one that I sent you, but the version I have does not have two events at the same time, and it still does not work.  

When you say scheduled at the same time, do you mean executed or triggered.  They are triggered at the same time, but due to delays they are not executed at the same time.  Priorities are only used when events are executed at the same time.

Will send you in separate message my current project.

The replacement should be going from the top level to the sub model version.  So, it should be the top level initial amount.  Again, maybe your project is different, so I will send you mine.
