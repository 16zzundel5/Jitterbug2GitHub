OK, yes this seems to work, although the file structure is a little different
from that in Followup 1.   


These files:
   filename.cc  : timed concurrent events 
   filename.cf  : conflict events 
   filename.cs  : timed cause events
   filename.re  : next/revious reverse events
have been merged into one file, named
   filename.rel
Also the precedence graph now appears in 
   filename.pg

In any case, this stuff is no longer dumped to atacs.log.
I will now close this report.
