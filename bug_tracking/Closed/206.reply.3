Subject: Re: memlatchALL.csp core dumps during timed state space exploration. (PR#206)
Date: Wed Aug  4 15:59:21 1999

As Wendy points out in the notes, the seg fault is gone (see below).
Therefore, I will close this report.  
However, it still deadlocks.  So if it should not deadlock, please followup to
that effect, and then move this to Incorrect Behavior.
