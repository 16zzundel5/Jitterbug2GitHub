Hi, 

Looking at the stack traces you sent, I think I have a rough idea of how this
happened.  It appears that you were 
adding a complex formation connection between two species.  Somehow the species
you were connecting too 
seems to have no longer existed in the model.  I wonder if perhaps you deleted
the species, but it was somehow 
still showing up in the schematic.  When you tried to make this complex
connection to this missing species, the 
addition of the complex formation reaction failed.  This created a partial
complex formation reaction.  
Unfortunately, this partial reaction is causing problems, and it is why the
other two exceptions occurred.  The 
model can likely be fixed by switching to tabular editor (right click on the
model file to do this and select 
view/edit (tabular).  Then, you can go to the reaction tab and find a reaction
named Complex_<speciesId> and 
remove this reaction.  My guess is that <speciesId> is missing in the species
tab.  

Curious though how you got into this situation.

Thanks,

Chris
