Problem is indeed in postproc.cc.  Even turning postprocess off does not 
help due to the issue that individual files are compiled first before 
commands are executed (problem we discussed before).  A workaround would 
be to go to memaloc.c and change default of design->postproc and 
design->redchk to FALSE.  Don't check this in though as it is not a good 
general solution as it will make all the regressins tests now not use 
postprocessing.  One way to trace this down would be to compare what the 
tel's look like after postprocessing each component (use -ov).  This is 
likely a lot of work though as the example is very large.  My guess is 
that it may be a conflict issue, but I'm not sure.  Hope this helps for 
now till I have more time to look at it.

Chris
