hi,
There are serval syntax errors about ATACS generated VHDL code:
1. All the ! and ? can not be compiled.
2. The entity or architecture names cannot have " . " in it, such as
   the name we have here "mpegdecoder.ctrl_HSE_BESTS" 
3. There are some declarations which should be declared in the entity
   instead of the architecture internal signal.  For some of the vhdl, 
   there are no declarations in the entity, all of them are in the 
   internal signal declaration part; for some of the vhdl, the declarations 
   have been declared both in the entity and the internal signal.
4. The time delay is too big to simulate. Such as (0,2147483647).

thanks a lot. :)
