Subject: Re: BUG: bug database does not allow bugs to be submitted by web form (PR#5252)
Date: Fri Jul 22 19:30:34 2011

This is happening because the file
"/home/shang/atacs-bugs/bug_tracking/reportform.html" is blank.  The files
"reportformA.html" and "reportformB.html" appear to have parts of what used to
be the web form in them, so the web form could possibly be reconstructed from
these files.  Also, "/home/shang/httpd/cgi-src/jitterbug-1.6.2/config/reportform.html"
is the default jitterbug template file that could be used to recreate the form.
