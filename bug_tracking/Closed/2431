Add support for modifiers?

Kinetic law must only refer to species that are reactants, products, or
modifiers.

Add support for stoichiometryMath?  

stoichiometry must be > 0 (default is 1)

Only one of stocihiometry or stoichiometryMath can be used at a time

reactants/products may contain a species more than once

warning when local parameter shadows another id

reaction id can be used in kineticLaw of another reaction and refers to
the rate of the reaction.
