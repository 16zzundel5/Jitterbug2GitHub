I have run the library of examples through atacs with the following results:

railroadcontroller.vhd -- 1) parentheses bug
corbett.vhd -- 1) nonsupport of sync function (newly added to handshake 
package)
fish2.vhd -- 1) nonsupport of span within 'above statement
                          Example: x'above(span(7.0,11.0));
                     2) nonsupport of constant placed within 'above 
statement
                           Example: x'above(a); (where a is defined above as 
a constant with a real value)
                      3) parentheses bug (as in railroadcontroller.vhd)
active.vhd -- 1) nonsupport of constant placed within above statement (as in 
fish2.vhd)
                       2) following the replacement of a constant with a 
real value, the example caused a
                                 segmentation fault when run through atacs, 
for reasons unknown
