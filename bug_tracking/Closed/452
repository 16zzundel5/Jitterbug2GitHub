Submission from: chou.elen.utah.edu (155.99.23.202)
Submitted by: killpack


During compilation of a vhdl file, process names are converted to 
process_name.tel.

If two different blocks (ex: environment and synthesized unit) have a process
with the same name, when the design is compiled, one of the processes' tel
structure file will overwrite the other one.
