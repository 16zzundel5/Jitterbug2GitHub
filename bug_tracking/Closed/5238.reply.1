This is done, with the caveat that the edit promoter button in the influence
panel only works if the currently selected promoter is something other than
default, but since we're getting rid of default I didn't bother to work around
it.  In the meantime, we can still use the schematic promoter button to edit the
default promoter of freshly dropped influences.
