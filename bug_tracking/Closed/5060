I was confused by the rate law generated for RNA polymerase binding to a pr=
omoter P activated with transcription factor B. As it stands, the first ter=
m in such a rate law is Ka*RNAP*pow(B, nc)*P. If we aren=E2=80=99t ignoring=
 the RNA binding step as non-rate limiting, then it seems to me that we sho=
uld be multiplying by the eq constant for RNAP binding to the activated pro=
moter (let=E2=80=99s call it Kact). I suppose that Kact could be equal to 1=
 or bound up in Ka, but in the latter case we=E2=80=99d be double counting =
Kact when nc =3D 2 because Ka is actually pow(Ka, nc), despite not being ex=
plicitly shown as such. I feel like there=E2=80=99s something I=E2=80=99m m=
issing here, but I=E2=80=99m not sure what.=20
