The reason it does this is you have three commands in your command line 
which execute a complete attempt at synthesis (-eR -ya -sv).  

The current assumption is that the tool executes the commands in the same
way command line as interactive.  That is that it will run the second command
even though the first fails.  In interactive, this is okay because you may
have changed the source file.  In command line, it just repeats the same 
problem.  

My inclination is it may be difficult to determine whether to go forward or
not.  For example, if you have a CSC error, a legel command sequence would be
to doall (-ya) then do state assignment then doall again.  This will work now,
but if we change it it will fail the first time and not try to solve CSC.

Thoughts?
