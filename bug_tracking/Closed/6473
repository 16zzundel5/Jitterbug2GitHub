Vehicle Service
This vehicle should have codes to read for transmission's electrical controls but just my hunch is lack of pressure to begin with by the description either low fluid level, unable to pick up fluid in pan after sloshing forward when stopping or pump just not up to snuff anymore and yes if so it's killing itself or at least not making it any better to keep using it this way.

Try something. Check fluid level with engine off and again with it running as suggested. Is it reading the same? It shouldn't and if so may have troubles picking up fluid in pan drawing up air not much unlike air in brake lines don't work well or at all.
http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/usedoil/oilchange/FAQ.htm

These things whatever the cause by the time trans isn't behaving can really wear out plain friction items quickly, bands, clutch packs, drums and usually show dirty dark fluid first but not always.

Choices if no other here has suggestions for you.
*-Get it diagnosed at a transmission specialty shop.

* Change fluid and filter which doesn't get all fluid out but does give you look inside pan and clean it. A or B, flush thru first with new fluid then drop the pan for that job - techs can reasonably disagree on what might be best at this point and age of it.

** Risk: If untouched fluid since new and a wear issues is happening changing fluid either kills it faster or might prolong the agony of an overhaul which about now I think you are facing.

Question of possible importance: Has this vehicle been routinely serviced by a Quickie Nifty place? Things can happen anywhere by anyone but some pretty scary news comes from those places noting you noted fluid too full Wonder if even proper fluid was added or what?
