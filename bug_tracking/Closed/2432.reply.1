The following issues remain:

trigger must evaluate to Boolean

delay must evaluate to non-negative number
 
units of delay should be time

event ID does not seem to work

does name work?

each variable can only be assigned once in an event

variable in assignment cannot appear in an assignmentRule

assignment math units should be consistent with the variable
