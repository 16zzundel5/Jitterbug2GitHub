I no longer get the exception, but I'm having problems with the  
example still.

When you remove a transition that is a failure transition, you should  
also remove it from the list of failure transitions otherwise atacs  
complains that the transition is not declared.

I cannot remove the failure transition indication from t2 using the  
LHPN editor.  I had to remove it manually from the file.

After I removed it, the abstraction result I got was not correct.
