I was referring to changed made in another GCM.  I think you're right that
changing them in the parameter editor would work.  That's probably how I
should have been doing it anyway.  What I was saying was that if you change
something in another GCM (eg, a grid component) and then you save and go
back to the analysis view and hit "save and run", the SBML won't get those
saved changes to the other component, as far as I can tell, as it's not
re-generating the SBML.
