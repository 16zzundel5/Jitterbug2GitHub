Subject: Re: BUG: abstraction of species used only in a rule (PR#4574)

Still need to check the following:
1) Initial assignment is for a relevant species.
2) Algebraic rule includes a relevant species.
3) Assignment or rate rule expression is for a relevant species.
4) Event trigger, delay, or assignment expression involves an assignment
to a relevant species.

An irrelevant species still needs to be removed from:
1) An event assignment to it.  The event should be removed if no assignments
remain after removing the one to the irrelevant species.
2) An algebraic rule which is composed of irrelevant species.

Reactions involving relevant species should not be removed.  This may in turn
make more things relevant.
