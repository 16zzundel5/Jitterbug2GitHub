Code has been added to Translator.java to support persistent transitions. For
persistent transitions, the following 
changes were made. Move this request to "Needs testing". 
If transition t0 does not have conflict set, create an event like before and set
the event to be persistent.
If transition t0 does not have conflict set, the pseudo-code below shows the
conversion. 

p0 - {e0}[d0]<a0> -> t0
p0 - {e1}[d1]<a1> -> t1

Rule:
t0 = piecewise(1, (*t0 & e0) | (*t0 & t0), 0)

Event:
trigger t0
pers    false
delay  d0
assignments
  *t0 = 0
   t0* = 1
   <a0>
