Chris-  The .g file isn't parsing properly for this example, but it looks 
like the parentheses bug has been fixed.  From what I can tell, the .tel 
file looks fine, but some odd behavior is taking place when the .g file is 
generated.  Line 18 of railroadcontroller.g is "p_10 d_4P1#@ 
(~((~(app))&(~(ex)))&(~(app))&(ex)&~(&))[0,0]".  I am guessing that the ~(&) 
near the end of the line is the product of incorrect parsing rules.  This 
same behavior occurs a few other times in the .g file.  I hope this helps 
you out some.  - Kevin Jones
