The function addInitialAssignment should only add dimensions and indices when needed.  To determine this, the math should be checked to see what the dimensions of the math are.  If they are scalar, then add the dimensions and indices as done now.  Otherwise, should compare dimensions with those for the variable.  If the math dimension number or sizes don't match, then there should be an error.  Otherwise, simply add the math with no dimensions or indices added.  This is to cover the case where the assignment is with other arrays or using the vector operator.
