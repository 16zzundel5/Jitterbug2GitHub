The problem was caused by the new lines you added to refresh:

gcm.reloadSBMLFile();
compartmentPanel.refreshCompartmentPanel(gcm.getSBMLDocument());
speciesPanel.refreshSpeciesPanel(gcm.getSBMLDocument());
parametersPanel.refreshParameterPanel(gcm.getSBMLDocument());
reactionPanel.refreshReactionPanel(gcm.getSBMLDocument());

I have commented them out, but I'm sure this causes other problems with whatever
you were trying to do here.

The refresh function gets called a lot.  It basically rebuilds the schematic. 
However, if you have changed the 
sbml document then reloading the file here will wipe out any changes you make. 
Namely, you add a reaction or 
species to the SBML document then reload the old document and this change is now
gone.  

Is this only for the parameter editor perhaps?
