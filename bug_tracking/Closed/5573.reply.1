Subject: Re: BUG: layout info and external model definitions aren't deleted (PR#5573)
Date: Sat Nov 19 18:56:04 2011

I've added code to remove unused external model definitions.  However, when I
deleted a component from a 
grid, the layout information was removed.  Could you double check this problem? 
If it is a problem, please send 
me a detailed example of how to reproduce it.

Thanks,

Chris
