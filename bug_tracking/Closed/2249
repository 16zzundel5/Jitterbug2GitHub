Use the model name as the file stem for the filename, and this should be
how it is referenced in the project window.  In other words, 

New -> Model

should ask "Enter Model ID" and the file should show up as
<ModelID>.sbml in the project window.  Note that we should discuss
whether or not to show the .sbml or not.
