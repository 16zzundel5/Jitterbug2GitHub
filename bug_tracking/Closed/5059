When modifying parameters in analysis view, setting a parameter to original=
 changes it to the GCM=E2=80=99s default value rather than to the original =
value. For instance, I had a GCM in which species B was set to a custom cou=
nt of 10, and it was my expectation that setting B=E2=80=99s species count =
to original in analysis view would set it back to 10. Instead, doing so set=
 B to the GCM=E2=80=99s default count of 0. I think =E2=80=9Coriginal=E2=80=
=9D should either do what I think it should or be changed to =E2=80=9Cdefau=
lt,=E2=80=9D since that=E2=80=99s a more apt description of its current fun=
ctionality.=20
