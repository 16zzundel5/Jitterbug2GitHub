Subject: CHANGE: add support for constitutive promoters
Date: Wed, 3 Nov 2010 14:27:14 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

In the GCM file, it is possible to have an influence of the form:

none -> A, promoter P

This should display in the schematic as:

P -> A

where P is a promoter from which A is produced.

This means having promoters as a potential new type of node in the  
graphs.  In other words, both should be possible:

A -P-| B

AND

A -| P -> B

A promoter should have a property which says whether a promoter is  
shown explicitly or not.  Promoters that are shown explicitly should  
not be allowed to be selected as an implicit promoter on an  
influence.  Promoters which are used implicitly should not be allowed  
to be added as also an explicit promoter.
