Subject: Re: CHANGE: when saving gcm files update analysis views (PR#2529)

I have added a method to the BioSim class that will update any open analysis
views that are linked to a gcm or sbml file.  This function is called
updateViews and takes a String that is the name of the file that has just been
updated as an argument.  For example, if you have a gcm file called foo that you
just saved to, you would call this method like so:

<name of the BioSim object>.updateViews("foo.gcm");

If you have any other questions, let me know.  Moving to GCM2SBML.
