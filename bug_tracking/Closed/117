In the X interface,
I would use a monospaced font (e.g., Courier) for any window that displays
state vectors, cubes, or tables.  That way columns would line up.  Also
currently each such window has a default size and shape that does not let
you see all of its report (without first changing the size).  In cases
where it is possible to do so, I'd open the window to an initial size and
shape for which all its contents are visible.
