Well, it appears to be a combination of things.  First:

Hao: Check in compile.c the function call rm_red seems to eliminate
ordering rules since they are self-loops often.  rm_red should not touch

Eric M.: Wendy's wipe out of reset rules only adjusts ncausal.  It should
adjust ncausal if it is a causal rule and adjust nord if it is an ordering
rule.  Can you make this change?
