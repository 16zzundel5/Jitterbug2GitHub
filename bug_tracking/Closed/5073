Subject: FEATURE: add notion of complex species to gcm
Date: Mon, 23 Aug 2010 12:10:37 -0600

In the species editor, allow the user to provide a chemical formula  
for the species composed of the other species.  Reactions need to be  
created to construct and destroy this complex.  This complex can be  
used now in influences.  This can subsume both dimerization and  
biochemical.  Note that abstractions for them will need to be updated.
