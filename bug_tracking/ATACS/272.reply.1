Many of these examples are bad (most of the vhd, for example), and better error
messages come out for those that should not work.

Those examples that are ok now all work when untimed.  Some examples, chantal,
pab_pa, and pab_pla run into problems when a timing method is used.  Therefore,
leaving in potential problem for now.
