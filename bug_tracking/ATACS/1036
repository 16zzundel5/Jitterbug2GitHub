The Certify target in the examples Makefile was changed to remove the 
noPostProc target.  This is due to the fact that the hpn examples cannot be 
run successfully with post processing enabled.  It would be nice if changes 
could be made either to the Makefile to allow the non-hpn examples to be run 
with the noPostProc or better yet change the code so that the hpn examples 
can be run with post processing turned on.

Thanks,
Scott
