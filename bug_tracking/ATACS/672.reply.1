That line has a port named "output".
ATACS doesn't like this, because it thinks that "output" is a keyword.
Indeed this is a bug in ATACS, because "output" is not a VHDL keyword.
I think this problem stems from the fact that ATACS shares one scanner 
(and parser) for both VHDL and CSP/HSE.

NOTE:  I haven't done anything about this, this is just FYI.
