ATACS still parses for loops in VHDL, without complaining about the
for loop itself, and then attempts synthesis.  That sort-of
constitutes claiming to support them.  The synthesis fails, because
the for loop is not actually implemented.  So, I'd still call that
Incorrect Behavior (rather than a Feature request.)

If, on the other hand, parsing a for loop issued an error like
	for loops are not yet supported
and then stopped processing, in that case I'd call this a Feature
request to add support for for loops.
