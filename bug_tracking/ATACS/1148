Subject: Missing Transitions

Transitions that are not declared in the .dummy line of a LHPN disappear 
when the graph is displayed using atacs (atacs -cPlloddl).  It would be 
useful for the program to give some kind of warning or error to show what is 
going on, or that the program is trying to connect a place to another place, 
rather than simply dropping the transition and leaving a dangling place.
