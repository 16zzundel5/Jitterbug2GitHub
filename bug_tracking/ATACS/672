I did exactly the same thing as i did before, but i got the following errors
this time, please help...... :p  also i think the error message is not clear
enough, i think it should say if the code has the parse error, or it is the
ATACS error. In this case, i simulated the code by using ModelSim successfully.
:p   
  

ATACS VERSION 5.1
