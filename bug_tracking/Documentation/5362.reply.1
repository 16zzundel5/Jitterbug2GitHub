Hi Nico,

I've tried unsuccessfully to construct a static build of reb2sac.  This would be
simplest to distribute to avoid the hassle of making people build this locally. 
Do you know of any way to tell gcc to construct an executable that is compatible
with earlier version of linux?  If we were to compile for an earlier version,
which version or versions would we need to target?  Any suggestions on the best
way to make the install more linux distribution flexible would be very happily
received.

Perhaps, the only solution is to distribute source for both our C/C++ programs
and libsbml on linux and make compilation part of the installation.  However, I
would love to avoid this hassle, if at all possible.

Thanks,

Chris
