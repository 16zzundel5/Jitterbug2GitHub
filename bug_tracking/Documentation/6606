Subject: CHANGE: Mention simulator selection for Monte Carlo stochastic
 analysis on iBioSim Version 2.8 Systems Biology Tutorial
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

The stochastic analysis on this tutorial (Section 5) describes the
setup for stochastic analysis. The simulator type is only indicated on
the screenshot, "SSA-Direct", but not mentioned in the text. But the
default stochastic simulator for iBioSim is "gillespie". Also,
screenshot needs to be updated for this one too, as SSA-Direct in
version 2.9 has been replaced by three separate simulators: Dynamic,
Flatten, and Hierarchical.
