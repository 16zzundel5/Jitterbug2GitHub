 species, reactions, etc

After dropping a species on canvas in BioSim, one has to quit the
adding species mode, before he can edit the species. Without quitting
this mode, a new species gets added when one clicks on an existing
species. Quitting the add mode can be done by clicking on the "select"
symbol, or by pressing "esc" on the keyboard.
