Subject: FEATURE: Create a LEMA tutorial 
Date: Fri, 20 Aug 2010 13:19:06 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.936)

Using the information below create a LEMA tutorial:

1)Type LEMA to bring up LEMA gui.
2)File -> New -> Project (Enter name)
3)File -> New -> Labeled Petri Net (Enter name, say one). After this,  
you'll see one.lpn in the left sidebar.
4)Right click on one.lpn (or whichever lpn you created in step 3) and  
choose "Create Learn View". Enter a name (say learn).
5)The learn view has 3 tabs - Data Manager, Learn, and TSD Graph. Data  
manager is used to import/view the raw simulation data. learn tab is  
used for model generation from the simulation data provided in data  
manager. TSD graph tab is used to view the data that's imported in the  
data manager.
You should see the data manager by default. Click "Import" at the  
bottom and point to the simulation data file in csv/dat/tsd or any  
other format. Import all the simulation data files that you have for  
the circuit being modeled.
6)Click the learn tab. Here, you can configure the parameters used for  
model generation through the basic options and advanced options tabs.  
A brief description of some of the parameters:
Number of bins (in the top portion) - Useful if the number of bins is  
the same for all the variables.
Scale Factor for Values/Time - Optional. If not mentioned, it chooses  
automatically.
Port - can be NA (not applicable to the model), Input, or Output.
Mode - Control signal which is capable of destabilizing the delays/ 
values on transitions. This causes an internal state variable to be  
generated for each output variable.
Care - Care sequence. If a variable is not selected as a care, it will  
not be included in the state variables list for places. However, it'll  
be used in the enabling conditions.
Epsilon and the options on the advanced options tab can be adjusted  
for configuring a variable to be as either "continuous" or "DMV". DMV  
variables are discrete-valued variables.
Selecting "Use User Generated Levels" and clicking "Suggest Levels"  
lets you see the auto-generated thresholds. Choosing "Auto" in the  
"number of bins" drop-down menu of a variable causes the number of  
bins to be auto-determined for dmv variables.
7) After configuring the parameters, click the green "Play" button on  
top left or click File -> Save and Learn.
8) Once you see the "Learning Complete" pop-up, go to File->Save  
Models and enter a name to see the generated lpn file in the left  
sidebar. Double click to see the raw lpn file. Right click and select  
"View Model" to convert it to a dot file which can be viewed using a  
graph viewer software like Graphviz. You can view the generated lpn  
file in graph format by typing dotty path/filename.dot from the  
terminal.
9) Right click the lpn file on the left sidebar and click "Convert to  
Verilog" to see the SystemVerilog file (with the same name and .sv  
extension) in the left sidebar.
