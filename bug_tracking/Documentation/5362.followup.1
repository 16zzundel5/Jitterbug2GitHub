Having the option to download the sources is always a nice option, even 
if the default package distributed tried to
do everything for the users. You can have a section at the end of the 
installation instructions with a link to the sources
and some basic instructions of what to do. Some people like me could 
have problems to run the default pre-compiled libraries,
some other people might want to re-compile the programs themselves to 
optimized the compilation for their system. And having that
option remove some burden on your back to have packages that can run 
anywhere.

Lisbml, the sources are available elsewhere, so that is not a problem, 
we can easily replace the pre-compiled libraries with some other.
That was nice to have the version numbers of libsbml at least in the .so 
files, as I was about to complain again that I could not find anywhere 
the libsbml version
that needed to be used with iBioSim, as at first I saw only the jar file 
and I tried to find some indications in the documentation without 
success, that's only when I
found the .so file that I found out the version of libsbml to use.

Thanks,
Nico
