Subject: CHANGE: Reverse the order of creating kinetic law and making reaction
 reversible on iBioSim Version 2.8 Systems Biology Tutorial
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

In Section 9, in the description of the Reaction Editor, it says
"Press the Use Mass Action button to automatically create a kinetic
law for this reaction. Then, make this reaction reversible and adjust
its forward reaction rate to be 1.0". This, however, would not alter
the created kinetic law to include reverse reaction, leaving kinetic
law "kf * CII * P1" unchanged. We should first make the reaction
reversible, and then generate the kinetic law, which includes the
reverse reaction's effect. The kinetic law on the screenshot for this
description is correct.
