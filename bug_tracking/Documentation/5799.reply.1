From Jason:


Pretty sure they're functional--last time I checked they were.  There should be
something somewhere (a 
comment?) about what the arguments are.  One of them is used in the program and
has full information and one 
is shorthand (the one-argument one) that you use in GUI, I think.  There should
be code that looks for those 
function names and then parses the arguments.  If I recall correctly, the
arguments are the compartment name, 
the x position, and the y position?  Something like that.

getCompartmentLocation returns the compartment location x or y position.  It's
used in conjunction with the 
neighborquantity functions to get the position.  I think the one with only a
single argument is just the 
compartment name, and then the program adds the other two arguments
automatically because you can't specify 
those before runtime.

So if you're using the neighborQuantity functions, you only use the ones with
one argument.  The other one is 
only used at runtime by the simulator.
