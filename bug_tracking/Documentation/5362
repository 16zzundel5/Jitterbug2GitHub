Subject: FEATURE/CHANGE : iBioSim pre-compiled program
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,

While trying to use IBioSim, I noticed that some programs did not work 
on our setup (Centos 5.4), which I was expecting as the compilation 
seems to have been made for Fedora 13.

Is it possible to get the sources of the programs to be able to compile 
them locally which would be the best for us or to get a version compiled 
for an earlier version of Linux ?

Here is the error I am getting in the 'command log' frame :

--------------------------------------
Executing:
reb2sac --target.encoding=rkf45 /homes/rodrigue/sbmlData/iBiosim/1/Test1.xml

Errors:
reb2sac: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.7' not found (required by 
reb2sac)
--------------------------------------


Thanks,
Nico
