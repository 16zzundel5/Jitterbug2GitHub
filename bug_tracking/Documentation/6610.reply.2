Subject: Re: BUG: Reaction-based abstraction does not speed up Monte Carlo simulation (PR#6610)
Date: Sat Jul 23 20:36:48 2016

The problem with this one is that the event, rule, and constraints must be
removed for the abstraction to take place 
completely.  This should be updated in the tutorial to make this clear.  Moving
this to documentation.
