Subject: BUG: Reaction-based abstraction does not speed up Monte Carlo simulation
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

The reb2sac gillespie simulator does not seem to speed up when
reaction-based abstraction is applied. Example file is the phage
lambda decision circuit in the Systems Biology tutorial. The SSA
without abstraction took 13.61866835 seconds, but the one with
reaction-based abstraction took 12.133898569 seconds. Note that the
Total_CI assignment rule was disabled for the reaction-based
abstraction.
