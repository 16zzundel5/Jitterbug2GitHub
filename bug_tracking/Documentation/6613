Subject: CHANGE: Description does not match histogram on iBioSim Version 2.8
 Systems Biology Tutorial
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

The following description for the histogram on Section 7 says: "The
histogram shown here indicates that CI goes above 20 molecules first
about 21 percent of the time, CII goes above 50 molecules first about
74 percent of the time, and the simulation terminates before either
happens about 5 percent of the time". This does not match the
histogram shown right below it, whose percentages are 45, 55, and 0.
