Subject: CHANGE: Should use the "State-based" abstraction instead of none on
 iBioSim Version 2.8 Systems Biology Tutorial
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Section 7's title is "State-based Abstraction", but the instruction in
its first paragraph says: "Go back to the Simulation Options tab and
change abstraction back to none, ...". Should this be "State-based
Abstraction" instead?
