Subject: CHANGE: Update screen shot for analysis view on iBioSim Version 2.8
 Systems Biology Tutorial
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

The screen shot showing "Simulation Options" needs to be updated.
Specifically, there are now two analyzers for Runge-Kutta_Fehlberg in
iBioSim, but the screen shot was taken when there was only one. Also,
BioSim now uses Task ID instead of the previous Simulation ID shown on
the current screen shot.
