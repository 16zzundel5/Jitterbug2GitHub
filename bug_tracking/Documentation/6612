Subject: CHANGE: Update instruction on enabling constraints on iBioSim Version
 2.8 Systems Biology Tutorial
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

The second sentence of Section 7 State-based Abstraction, gives
instruction on enabling the previous disabled constraints. It says "To
do this, go to the SBML Elements tab and check the boxes next to the
constraints". This seems outdated as there is no SBML Elements tab.
Instead, it should be the Schematic tab in the analysis view.
