Subject: Re: BUG: Disallow ids that may conflict with arrays objects (PR#6066)
Date: Wed Jun 11 22:05:25 2014

Before adding a dimension id, should make sure there is no other element with
the same id in the model.  
Otherwise, we need to rename the id to something else.  Maybe dd0, etc.  

Also, should disallow any id's to be added to the model which are already in use
as dimension ids.

Perhaps a simpler approach will be to not allow id's of the form "d#", but this
may be too heavy handed to 
enforce.
