Subject: CHANGE: Update the first screenshot on learn tool on iBioSim Version
 2.8 Systems Biology Tutorial
To: atacs-bugs <atacs-bugs@vlsigroup.ece.utah.edu>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

The current one shows creation of a learn view from a different model
than lambda.xml. It probably should be lambda.xml. Also, the menu
appeared after right-clicking has also been updated since the
screenshot was taken.
