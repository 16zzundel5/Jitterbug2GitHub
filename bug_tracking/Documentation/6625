In Section 9, it refers to the white square icon as "Add Component",
but it is "Add Module" in BioSim. The screenshot even shows the window
as "Add Module(s)". Here is the sentence: "Finally, select the Add
Component icon and click on the Schematic canvas opening the Add
Component(s) window. In this window, browse the combo box to find your
CII_degradation model. Pressing OK will then add it to your
schematic".
